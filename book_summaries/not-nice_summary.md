## 🧭 Key ideas in *not-nice*

- [1. They have lots of fights that consist of volleying accusations back and forth at each other: “You did this to me, and then you did that to me, and you made me do this, and made me feel this way!” If one person is honest and shares a challenge they’re having in the relationship, the other person exclaims in pain and horror, “How could you say something like that to me?](#key-idea-1)
- [2. The pressures from our Superego to be good, to be nice, to be giving, to be loving, to be generous, to forgive, to put others first, to do a perfect job, to not slack off, to give it our all and do our best all the time on everything, to do better at work, earn more money, spend less and save more, eat better, cook more at home, work out more, get in better shape and look better naked, be funnier, more outgoing, have more friends, not drink so much, not eat sugar, and for heaven’s sake, just be better than you are right now!](#key-idea-2)
- [3. Instead, you can simply point out what you noticed to enter the conversation: “I noticed that you share a lot of the details of your remodel with me…” “I noticed that you like to put paper bags in that drawer…” “I noticed you scheduled eight appointments for Barry this week and only 3 appointments for me.” “I noticed I sent an email on Monday and you responded to me on Friday.” These are just a few examples among the millions of things you could notice in your interaction.](#key-idea-3)
- [4. As you listen, reflect on what you are hearing to make sure you understand it clearly: “So, you like to have a lot of paper bags around because you can use them for garbage or recycling?” “This remodel is a huge deal for you and your family and it helps to talk it through with someone, is that right?” In certain situations, the other person may challenge what you noticed, stating that didn’t happen.](#key-idea-4)
- [5. One that is going to be familiar to you by now, as it is repeated with each of these Pillars of Not Nice: You can choose to start saying no when you want to and need to, and face the initial discomfort, or you can continue to avoid saying no, and continue to play nice to avoid the disapproval of others.](#key-idea-5)
- [6. One of my mentors in graduate school, Matt May, told me this phrase which I’ll never forget: “You can say anything, if you say it in the right way.” I use that as a reminder when I want to say no, or ask for what I want, and I feel like it’s “wrong” or “inappropriate.” In this instance, the choice to attend less about her, instead of about them, is a much more skillful way to communicate her desire.](#key-idea-6)

## 🔹 Key idea 1 of 6 <a name='key-idea-1'></a>

### ✨ They have lots of fights that consist of volleying accusations back and forth at each other: “You did this to me, and then you did that to me, and you made me do this, and made me feel this way!” If one person is honest and shares a challenge they’re having in the relationship, the other person exclaims in pain and horror, “How could you say something like that to me?


After fourteen years of clinical experience, working with thousands of people from all different cultures, I began to question this assumption. In fact, I saw that clients who were trying the hardest to be nice people also felt the most anxious, guilty, and frustrated. They had difficulty standing up for themselves, felt obligated to please others, and worried about what people thought of them. They couldn’t directly ask for what they wanted, freely say “no” when it was the right thing to do, or openly disagree with others’ opinions, even though they had strong, well-developed beliefs. In short, they were trapped in a cage of niceness that prevented them from being their real selves.

Sometimes that moment is provoked by dating, relationships, and love. They’re unable to meet and date the people they want, they endure poor treatment from partners who are only moderately interested, or they watch their marriage go down in flames.

For others, it’s their social life. They can’t take another day of being uncomfortable in their own skin, feeling inauthentic, phony, or forced in their interactions. They’re sick and tired of holding back their opinions, feeling guilty for never doing enough, and being so terrified of upsetting others that they’re sick to their stomach with worry about it.

That’s where I come in. As you’ll see in the pages that follow, niceness and people-pleasing were my story, my cage, my curse. I know how hard it can be to break free from the tentacles of guilt and fear that keep us in niceness. I know how strong the commands of that inner voice can be. The one that tells us we’re so bad for hurting someone’s feelings or saying no. That others will be upset with us for speaking our minds, or leave us for being honest.

### ✨ Instead, you can simply point out what you noticed to enter the conversation: “I noticed that you share a lot of the details of your remodel with me…” “I noticed that you like to put paper bags in that drawer…” “I noticed you scheduled eight appointments for Barry this week and only 3 appointments for me.” “I noticed I sent an email on Monday and you responded to me on Friday.” These are just a few examples among the millions of things you could notice in your interaction.


Breaking out of the niceness cage, however, is not a simple brute force move. You don’t just smash the side of the prison wall with a bulldozer and run free. Instead, finding your way out of niceness is more like maneuvering your way out of a straitjacket. You must wrestle with the old, long-standing beliefs that bound you with stories that it’s bad to ask for what you want, or that you’re selfish for saying no.

Instead, I just began to worry about how I was viewed by others. Do these people like me? Do they want to be my friend?

Then, one night, I reached a breaking point. I was a senior in college, finishing the time in my life that movies told me was supposed to be a crazy adventure of parties and hot dates. My life was no such thing. Instead, my world was safe, small: going to class, being with friends, and playing lots of video games.

Despite what that voice of fear and doubt says, more is possible for you. It’s possible to regain your freedom to express yourself, to say “no” and ask for what you want without guilt, and to unapologetically be yourself without all the worry about how others will react. As you do, life becomes better and better, and all your relationships thrive. You are able to find and create lasting love, form deep and fulfilling friendships, and become a powerful leader in your career.

is and the toll that living this way is taking on you. As you see just how rooted in fear our nice patterns are, and how it’s different from being a good and loving person, you’ll naturally let go of the old beliefs that don’t serve you. In these chapters you’ll be wriggling around, pulling some Houdini moves to get out of your straitjacket.

## 🔹 Key idea 5 of 6 <a name='key-idea-5'></a>

### ✨ One that is going to be familiar to you by now, as it is repeated with each of these Pillars of Not Nice: You can choose to start saying no when you want to and need to, and face the initial discomfort, or you can continue to avoid saying no, and continue to play nice to avoid the disapproval of others.


With that energy and determination, everything turned around. I made tremendous progress in my confidence and in being less nice. I began studying eBooks and online courses about how to meet women and be more confident. I discovered I could challenge the negative voice in my head and do the opposite of what it said. I made a practice of facing my fears. All of them. One by one.

One pattern I recently observed in myself was to earn approval through achievement. I noticed a hard-driving part of me that I call Double More (because it always wants me to do double and more of what I’m doing) pushing me to achieve more quickly. It was impatient to get to the next level and dissatisfied with my current rate of progress. When I explored why I needed to achieve more and faster, I found the urge came from a desire to impress others. Specifically my dad and one of my mentors.

This is how the young, emotional part of our brain sees relating to others. One false move and I’m plummeting to my death. Hence the strong sense of threat. The fear, anxiety, worry, rumination, and avoidance at all costs. Hence the strange phenomenon where you want to do something different, such as speak up, be more direct, or say no, and yet you find yourself doing the opposite: holding back, people-pleasing, and saying yes!
