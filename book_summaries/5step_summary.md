## Introduction

A job should be a pipeline of oil and cash that you stand in front of - you get a little dirty, but you're also "cleaning up" with all of that money that you can use to buy your time and freedom. If you're already knee-deep in your career (which I assume you are) and you're not happy with your job (which I assume you are, if you're reading this), you'll simply want to maximize the earnings potential that job holds. If you don't already have a job, or if you're in a state of transition right now, there are a number of careers that you can jump into without a college degree and make $50,000 or so per year - pretty much right out of the gate. If you have $100/month in ongoing expenses that you can't rid yourself of, you'll need to have assets of almost $35,000 yielding 3.5% (1,200/0.035) in order to generate the passive $1,200 per year you need to cover that expense without going out and actively earning that money at your job.
