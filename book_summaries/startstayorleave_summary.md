- [2. There has to be more to life than simply looking and climbing up, not to mention the fact that the higher up the ladder you climb, the farther people get to see you fall.When I reflect on my friends who are contemplating running for the highest office in the land, or running for governor of a state, or whatever is perceived as the highest echelon of their chosen field, I feel the urge to ask them what I am asking you: Do you want the measure of what you accomplish in life to be marked by titles, offices, and achievements?](#key-idea-2)
- [3. The more you know yourself, your end goals, your strengths and weaknesses, the attainability of your dreams, and who to look to when you are confused or conflicted, the more ready you will be to confidently stay where you are when the time comes.Here are five questions to consider as you weigh the decision to stay:¬†What are some potential long-term benefits of staying where you are?What are the reasons you are exploring leaving, and would you be better off staying and sorting out what is causing your unrest in the first place?Will staying allow you to grow more, or will it stunt your growth?Who are the people in your life who you can involve as you make this decision?Will you commit to no longer letting those who do not know anything about you have any impact on how you view yourself?](#key-idea-3)
- [4. It just means you have to know when it‚Äôs time to leave.‚ÄîThe challenge of being a domestic or interpersonal violence prosecutor is invariably that someone hurts or kills a person they claimed to ‚Äúlove.‚ÄùThe challenge of being a child abuse or child sex abuse prosecutor is at least twofold: (1) There is the loss of innocence you experience when the most vulnerable are hurt, terrorized, and abused; and (2) your mind begins to perceive threats to your own children where rationally they do not exist.The challenge of being a homicide prosecutor is you are always dealing with death‚Äîand it is often the kind of death we fear the most, the kind where the front door of our lives is kicked in, without a moment‚Äôs notice, no time to say goodbye, no time to make amends, no time to utter a petition.](#key-idea-4)
- [5. People‚Äôs feedback can spur you on, encourage you, verify you‚Äôre on the right track, or help you adjust your direction, but, ultimately, if you know yourself and have a deep sense of purpose in the decisions you make, then the verdict of your closing argument will be crystal clear.Advice for My Younger SelfHave you ever seen those celebrity interviews where the interviewer asks, ‚ÄúIf you could go back in time and have a talk with your younger self, what would you say?‚Äù My initial response to such questions is, ‚ÄúMy advice to my younger self would be to skip this interview when it is offered so I don‚Äôt have to answer stupid questions about talking to my younger self!‚ÄùBut, in some ways, it is the perfect question for us to ask ourselves at life‚Äôs markers.](#key-idea-5)
- [6. ACKNOWLEDGMENTSTerri, Watson, and Abigail, thank you for being the joy of my life.Mom and Dad, thank you for valuing education and hard work and providing more for your children than either of you had growing up.Laura, Caroline, and Elizabeth, thank you for being the best sisters any brother could have.Thank you to the women and men at the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office, the 7th Circuit Solicitor‚Äôs Office, and the 4th Congressional District Offices for your service to our state and country.Scattered among the pages of this book you will see some of my favorite colleagues from Congress, but I want to say a special thank-you to Tim Scott, Johnny Ratcliffe, and Kevin McCarthy.](#key-idea-6)

### ‚ú® If, on the other hand, you measure life‚Äîthe accumulation of the decisions you make‚Äîaccording to the longevity and significance of what is remembered even by a few, then I would say Frankie is still alive and well.You cannot script with precision what‚Äôs going to happen in the end, but by thinking through what you want to be said of you, how you want to be remembered‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs said at your visitation or memorialized in a book years later‚Äîit will give you direction on whether to start, stay, or leave when you find yourself at a crossroads.The Note You End OnWhen writing the closing argument for that first murder trial, there were a number of different angles to choose from.


Start at the End¬†As you‚Äôre thinking about starting something‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a new career or a new relationship, a new hobby or a new investment, starting fresh in a new city or starting to get more serious about your health‚Äîwhatever it is, I have found it‚Äôs best to start at the end. By creating a clear picture in your mind of your final destination, you will be better equipped to make decisions that ensure you reach that desired place.¬†Writing the Closing ArgumentFederal murder cases are rare.Because people tend to equate ‚Äúfederal crime‚Äù with ‚Äúmore serious crime,‚Äù they are often surprised to learn that the vast majority of murder cases are prosecuted not in federal but in state court, tried by state prosecutors. Only certain categories of murder warrant jurisdiction in the federal system‚Äîsuch as the murder of a federal judge, the murder of a federal law enforcement officer in the line of duty, or the murder of a federal witness.Prior to 1995, there had been only one federal murder prosecution in twenty-five years in the Upstate of South Carolina. Our state is divided into four regions. There is the Low Country near the beach (think Charleston). There is the region called the Midlands, which is where our capital of Columbia is. There is the Pee Dee region, which is largely agricultural. And there is the Upstate, which is a region connecting Atlanta, Georgia, to Charlotte, North Carolina, along Interstate 85. That‚Äôs where I live and have worked, and the region I represented in Congress.Just once in a quarter century had there been a federal murder case in my home region. But there would soon be two. The second one involved the murder of one of my own witnesses. I had just turned thirty years old and was still early into my career as a federal prosecutor. I was in a courtroom in Anderson, South Carolina, long before the advent of cellphones. We used pagers back then and my pager was vibrating a lot while I was in court that day. You don‚Äôt look down at your pager while you are in federal court, so I waited for a break and what I saw was a series of 911 pages from law enforcement officers. I hurried back to the judge‚Äôs chambers, which were adjacent to the courtroom, to use the nearest landline. When I reached one of the federal agents who had been paging me, his response was immediate and direct: ‚ÄúRicky Samuel has been killed.‚ÄùRicky Samuel was a young man from Spartanburg, South Carolina, who had been in some relatively minor legal trouble, but he was trying to change the course of his life. His current challenge was a pending federal drug case. The drug amounts were small but, as you will soon learn, even a small amount of drugs can have a significant impact on your life. Ricky was lucky in that he had a mother who loved him very much and was tougher on him than the court system was ever going to be. He also had a new girlfriend, and the thought of going to federal prison for any period of time was not likely to enhance this new relationship. Ricky had a decision to make. He could serve several years in federal prison for narcotics dealing or he could try to reduce his exposure to prison time.The federal drug system works like this: There are mandatory minimum prison sentences for even relatively small amounts of drugs. Five grams of cocaine base, commonly referred to as crack cocaine, equaled a mandatory minimum five years in prison. Fifty grams of cocaine base equaled a mandatory minimum ten years in federal prison. A gram is the size of a packet of Truvia or Sweet‚ÄôN Low. Ricky was charged with possessing an ounce of cocaine base, and even by pleading guilty and fully accepting responsibility, he would have received more than five years in federal prison. There is no parole in federal court so he would have served the overwhelming majority of whatever sentence was imposed.The only way to reduce one‚Äôs exposure to prison time, once arrested or indicted, is to cooperate with the government and have the government petition the court for a shorter prison sentence at the time of the sentencing hearing. Cooperating with the government means providing historical information on who one‚Äôs drug suppliers were or who were the partners or co-conspirators in the drug ring. Cooperating could also include more active work such as wearing a wire during an undercover drug transaction. In fact, the most significant cuts to prison sentences were often reserved for those who took the most risks in cooperating with the government. Wearing a wire and conducting undercover drug transactions were risky.I had hundreds of conversations with young men, and a few women, who, like Ricky Samuel, had that choice to make: do the time or cooperate and deal with the consequences of being labeled a ‚Äúrat.‚ÄùThe federal agents and I laid out Ricky‚Äôs options for him and his mother, and Ricky made the decision to cooperate with federal law enforcement in their investigation of a large South Carolina narcotics trafficking ring with ties to Florida.In reality, it was not much of a decision. Prison would be hard for Ricky. He was small in stature and had a slightly deformed arm, which would have made self-defense, often a necessity there, harder for him. He was not violent; he was just another young man who stopped his education too soon for the lure of easy and fast money. We shared with him that there were risks associated with cooperation, much like the doctor who goes over the risks before giving a flu vaccine or having relatively minor surgery. Yes, there is a chance something bad will happen, but the chances are so small that they tend not to even register. Until they do.We asked Ricky to help us in our investigation into Tommy Pabellon. Pabellon was a drug dealer who had sold cocaine base in larger amounts than someone like Ricky Samuel. Law enforcement‚Äôs plan had Ricky, acting in an undercover capacity, purchase cocaine base from Pabellon. It would be what the cops call a ‚Äúbuy bust.‚Äù An informant, typically wearing an audio or video wire or both, buys drugs from a suspected dealer with marked money. The deal is set up via phone or pager and those conversations are recorded as well. A short time after the transaction is completed, the dealer is arrested and, more often than not, the marked money is in his possession. These cases are common and not particularly complicated. The evidence consists of the recorded calls setting up the transaction, video and audio surveillance of the transaction itself, and then the proceeds of whatever is on the suspect when the arrest is made.Ricky did what he was told to do. The undercover drug transaction went down exactly as planned. Pabellon sold Ricky the drugs and was arrested a short time later and a short distance away with the marked buy money in his pocket.Once Pabellon was arrested, he had the same opportunity Ricky Samuel and others had‚Äîplead guilty, go to trial, or cooperate and lessen his exposure to prison. Pabellon opted for trial, and before the trial date was reached, the government had to produce what is called discovery, which is all of the evidence the government has as it relates to the defendant. The government tries to keep the identity of any informants or cooperating witnesses concealed for as long as possible, but inevitably those names are disclosed to the defense counsel, and then in turn the defendants themselves learn the identity of the informants. The disclosure of witness names is always a nervous time for prosecutors and agents and the witnesses themselves. Some defense attorneys share portions of the discovery with their clients but not all of it, and some defense attorneys just drop off the packets of information at the jail and allow the client to peruse the information for themselves. More than once discovery from one case has been found in the jail cell of another inmate. News about cooperating witnesses travels fast.The disclosure of witness names is one part of the criminal justice system that vexes those outside the system and frustrates those inside the system, even though we understand why it is necessary. Defendants have a constitutional right to ‚Äúconfront‚Äù witnesses as well as the right to know what evidence exists and will be presented at trial. The Confrontation Clause is in our U.S. Constitution. Even children have to testify in the trials of those who abuse them, sitting alone in a witness chair surrounded by adult strangers, with the defendant, the person who hurt the child, positioning himself squarely in the line of sight of the child. Our system affords significant safeguards to those accused of crimes, and part of that is knowing who the witnesses will be against that particular defendant.It is a separate and serious crime to threaten or intimidate witnesses. But sometimes those already charged with violating the law show disregard for other parts of the law.Tommy Pabellon found out during the discovery process that Ricky Samuel was the informant in his case, and he believed that if Ricky was not around to testify at trial, there would be no case against him. Pabellon devised a plan with other co-conspirators in his drug ring to have Ricky killed, and he hired an out-of-state hit man named Bob Harry Fowler. Fowler came to Spartanburg, South Carolina, and posed as a neighborhood street preacher in an effort to gain Ricky‚Äôs trust, doing door-to-door ‚Äúevangelizing‚Äù in Ricky‚Äôs neighborhood. The plan worked. Over the course of a few weeks, Bob Harry Fowler developed a relationship with Ricky and then, under the guise of taking him to be baptized, Fowler lured him to a remote pond in a neighboring county where he had Ricky get on his knees to pray the ‚ÄúSinner‚Äôs Prayer‚Äù and accept Jesus as his Lord and Savior. Fowler then shot Ricky twice in the back of the head.Ricky Samuel‚Äôs body was later found where he had been executed, beside that small pond in rural Greenville County, with two bullet wounds to the head. He was executed in retaliation for providing assistance and information to federal law enforcement officials. He was killed in a failed attempt to make the drug case against Tommy Pabellon disappear. No key witness, no case. At least that is what Pabellon thought.When I arrived at the murder scene, my first thought was of Ricky‚Äôs mother, of how we‚Äîfederal agents and prosecutors alike‚Äîhad assured her that the government would do everything in its power to protect her son if he decided to provide us with information. It was of little solace that we had explained what could happen. What was thought to be exceedingly rare‚Äîthe harming of a federal witness‚Äîhad in fact happened. Ricky had entrusted us with his life, and his mother had entrusted us with her son, and we had failed them both.Law enforcement gathered a general description of the new ‚Äúevangelist‚Äù in Ricky‚Äôs life from his family and friends, but Fowler had given a false name and left town immediately after he killed Ricky. Luckily, the forensics team found a Bible in Ricky‚Äôs home that Fowler had given to him as part of his street preacher ruse, and a forensics technician painstakingly went through that Bible, page by page, looking for fingerprints. When he found one, on a page in the book of Ezekiel, we ran the fingerprint through a national database to see if there was a match in anyone‚Äôs criminal history file. Because the ‚Äúevangelist‚Äù had prior convictions in other states, there was a hit in the database.How did a fingerprint from a contract killer from Alabama get on a Bible in Ricky Samuel‚Äôs home in Spartanburg, South Carolina? Why did this ‚Äústreet preacher‚Äù leave town so quickly after Ricky was killed? Why did the man who spent so much time around Ricky in the days and weeks before his death not even bother to attend his funeral? Those were just a few of the questions the prosecutors would ask the jury to reflect on at trial.The investigation into Ricky Samuel‚Äôs murder was long and difficult. After Bob Harry Fowler was identified, he was located and arrested for murder. But we had to connect him to Tommy Pabellon, and neither Fowler nor Pabellon was talking.While agents were actively working on putting the pieces of the murder case together, I decided to do something else: I decided to prove to Tommy Pabellon just how wrong he was about whether he could be prosecuted even without Ricky Samuel. So off to trial we went, and Pabellon was convicted of the drug charge even without Ricky Samuel present as a witness. But he also needed to be held to account for the murder of a federal witness.Law enforcement wound up arresting Tommy Pabellon‚Äôs wife on other charges and she eventually provided evidence and testimony against Tommy. The real break came when one of Tommy‚Äôs co-conspirators in their drug ring decided to cooperate, just as Ricky had, in an effort to reduce the significant time he was facing for conspiracy to murder a federal witness. We interviewed this co-defendant, corroborated his version of events, and planned on using him as a witness in the trial. He would have been a powerful witness, implicating both himself and Pabellon in the murder-for-hire scheme. And then this witness hanged himself in a prison cell.Law enforcement agents and prosecutors have to work with the evidence they have. They do not get to create the evidence they want or need. Fowler and Pabellon had the motive to kill Ricky Samuel, and Fowler had the means and access to do so. But still the trial would be about connecting Fowler to Pabellon. Pabellon did not pull the trigger, but he was the reason the trigger was pulled.The late, great federal prosecutor David C. Stephens and I prosecuted the case together. Stephens told me early on in our preparation that I would be doing the closing argument. All parts of a criminal trial are important, from pretrial motions and jury selection all the way through to the charging of the jury and the deliberations. But the closing argument is the last chance prosecutors get to make their argument to the jury. It is considered supremely important. I had made some closing arguments before but never in a case of this magnitude. And so I began a practice that I came to use in every case I prepared, prosecuted, and tried afterward: I started at the end.I wrote the closing argument first, and then worked my way backward to the beginning of the trial. There were witnesses to be called and examined and cross-examined. There were legal arguments to be made and exhibits to be introduced. I structured the presentation of evidence to get me to my desired ending.The closing argument is last. But it is also most important. I started with what was most important and made sure everything else worked in tandem with that.Starting at the end helped me in that first murder case, and I used that strategy in every trial thereafter. Eventually I embraced the tactic outside the courtroom, and it became the framework I‚Äôve employed in every major life decision I‚Äôve faced since then. Start at the end and then figure out how to get there.The Last SceneOne of the joys of middle age is that sometimes young people mistake longevity for wisdom. As a result, I frequently have young people visit or call, looking for advice on their nascent careers. I let them talk first, and what I typically hear is a confession of uncertainty, anxiety, and apprehension. They are not quite sure what they want to do‚Äîor even who they want to be‚Äîbut someone, somewhere told them they needed to have life figured out at the tender age of seventeen. And the pressure begins to mount, at least in their minds. Sometimes these young people are worried about making money; sometimes they are worried about finding a fulfilling career path. Most are worried‚Äîsome are even paralyzed‚Äîby the fear of making the wrong decisions.I remember one young man who came to see me when I was in Congress. He had life all mapped out, but it required him to gain admittance to one of our military academies. If that did not happen, according to him, nothing else would happen and his life was essentially over (at the age of seventeen) because it all hinged on going to West Point or the Naval Academy. Put aside for a second just how incredibly competitive those schools are and how little control the applicants have over whether or not they are selected. I could not get over his deep belief that all of his hopes and dreams hinged on being accepted at one of two highly competitive and selective schools.My first response had nothing to do with how to gain admittance to a highly selective college or university. I simply asked him where he wanted to wind up. It turned out he wanted to wind up exactly where I was, which was in Congress. ‚ÄúWho told you going to Annapolis or West Point was a necessary condition to running for Congress?‚Äù I asked him. ‚ÄúAnd who told you that even graduating from West Point or Annapolis would guarantee electoral success? And how will that make you a more effective member of Congress even if you are successful in both?‚Äù The real question, I tried to convince him, is not where he would spend the next four years but an even deeper, more significant question. Where did he want to be for his last four years? What did his last four months looks like? Last four minutes? Without being moribund, I wanted him to lean back in that chair in my office, close his eyes, and visualize a picture. The picture I wanted him to paint, with the most vivid details he could conjure, is the final scene.You can do the same.You‚Äôve passed from this world, hopefully after a long, happy, and healthy life, and family and close friends are waiting in a line to receive visitors. There is no more chance to leave a mark, make amends, rethink a decision, or change the story. Imagine the closing argument for your own life.When you think of that funeral scene, place yourself in that room eavesdropping on the conversations. If you see yourself as an angel, that‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt think I will qualify for that title, so I will go with just a spirit or a ghostlike figure lurking above the receiving line, but I want you to answer two questions:What have you accomplished?How are you remembered?Considering what people might say about them at their funeral usually snaps my young visitors to attention. (Or scares them away.) No one really enjoys thinking about the end. It‚Äôs hard and final, and it is understandable that we would rather dwell on happier thoughts. But death is one of the few things that is absolutely guaranteed in our lives, so these are important questions to ask, despite the uncomfortableness of it all. We have to will ourselves to do it‚Äîto think about the closing argument of life so we can structure the evidence and pick the witnesses who will testify about our lives. If life can be compared to a trial and if there is a final argument, a closing statement of sorts, what will be said and is there evidence to support it?The truth is, for many young adults figuring out what they want to do after they turn eighteen, their decisions revolve around vocation. What career field do they want to enter when they graduate? I try to encourage them to think of the other areas of their lives as well. What we seek to accomplish in life, in my judgment, should not be confined to a single area but should span relational, vocational, educational, and personal realms.We are human, of course, and a perfect balance is impossible, but thinking through how the various areas of life co-exist with one another helps give us better direction. If you make a lot of money but have no time for family, will you have accomplished what you want in life? If you are singularly focused on socializing in college and neglect your studies, are you setting yourself up to accomplish everything you want to achieve? All friends and no job is sort of like ‚Äúall hat and no cattle.‚ÄùAt any age, focusing on what we want to accomplish in a variety of areas will help give us that holistic picture as we move through life. When we decide to look at life through the lens of what we want to accomplish rather than simply what we want to do, life gains the significance we covet and our decision making will gain a sense of purpose.I wish I had a nickel for every young person who told me they wanted to make a difference in their community, their state, or their nation. Their motives were pure, near as I could tell. They really wanted to effectuate change. So, I listened and nodded my head as they explained to me why they needed to go to law school, and then go into politics or government, in order to bring about that change our society so desperately needed. And when it was my time to offer advice, it was always the same advice: If you want to change the world, you should teach.Teachers have changed my life more than any United States president or cabinet member. The person I live with, a first-grade teacher, will change the world more in one semester than I did in eight years in the House of Representatives.The prestige of what you do and the importance of what you accomplish are two entirely different things. The sooner we learn that truth, the more fulfilling life will be. If you are going to make the very best decisions in life, you are going to have to be honest with yourself. We all try to say the right things when others are listening. Say the honest thing when it is just you doing the talking and listening. I encourage these young people I have the good fortune to visit with to have a frank conversation with themselves about their real motivations as they relate to the decisions before them.Now, having a clear vision of the end is essential, but the actions you take to bring that image to life are what will determine whether you reach your desired destination. This is one case where it is not merely the thought that counts. You build your closing argument with the daily decisions you make. How you speak to people, how you make others feel, how you conduct your business, how well you take care of yourself and those you love, how much you help those in need, how generous you are with your time or money‚Äîall that is evidence that will be used and relied upon for your own closing argument in life.The things you think, do, and say each day are leading you to your final destination. Your decisions, wittingly or unwittingly made, will guide you somewhere, so I would encourage you not to keep that desired destination a secret‚Äîespecially from yourself. Put another way, the more you think about your closing argument now, the more likely you will be able to shape it between now and when folks put on their Sunday best to bid you farewell.And if we want to make the decisions that lead us to our desired closing arguments, we need to evaluate where we are now‚Äîas in today, the very moment you read this. If you need to change direction or the speed with which you are moving, now is the perfect time to analyze that. Are you happy in your career, school, major, key relationships? When you consider the big things like vocation, family, friendships, business relationships, and marriage, are you on track for your desired closing argument?What Do You Want to Accomplish?There is a tremendous difference between what we ‚Äúdo‚Äù and what we ‚Äúaccomplish.‚Äù Accomplishing something requires intent and purpose. Accomplishing something requires foresight of the ending. When we work toward accomplishing something, we have direction; if we are merely doing something, we are moving without direction, and we are more likely to get lost.For example, when I was considering college majors, I looked at what I needed to do to graduate, which was accrue 120 credit hours, rather than what I wanted to accomplish in life. I chose history because I went to college with six hours of Advanced Placement credit in history from high school, and that credit reduced the number of classes I needed for the major.I would have been much better off, in hindsight, majoring in philosophy so I could learn to think more critically or psychology so I could understand human nature. Thinking critically and understanding human nature are essential to helping people who have been the victims of crime, which is what ultimately wound up being what I wanted to accomplish in life.But still, I found a way to make it work because there are multiple routes to get to a destination. Some poor decisions cost you a lot, and some cost you next to nothing. I majored in history and wound up going to law school and ultimately found a career in the justice system that I loved. Even though I would have done college differently if given the chance, I eventually made sense of the path I chose and got to my destination despite the fact that the path was more circuitous than it needed to be.You are not ‚Äúfinished,‚Äù as that young man tried to convince me, if you don‚Äôt get into an elite military school. Your life is not ‚Äúover‚Äù because you didn‚Äôt get your dream job. You are not free to ‚Äúgive up‚Äù because you did not get an invitation to join this group or club. One misguided decision or unexpected setback might stop you from doing something specific, but it does not hinder you from accomplishing what you want to in life; it might just take you a little longer to get there. All routes may not be equal in length, difficulty, or scenery, but they can get you where you want to be if you are clear on your destination and dogged in your pursuit.Do not forget to consult your dreams. Usually when I ask young people what they hope to accomplish, I can see their eyes light up as they think about what some call dreams and others call goals or aspirations. Some of these young people are reluctant to verbalize those dreams for fear they will be perceived as too wild, fanciful, or unattainable. I am the first one to tell you that logic has a role in decision making. But it is essential and liberating to verbalize what we dream to be or¬†do.Logic and dreams can be roommates. They can be travel companions. That will be a recurring thread throughout this book (although some of the decisions I‚Äôve made in life may seem to indicate that logic was taking a nap while my dreams drove the car). Logic will and should take the lead. But when forming your image of the end and thinking through what you want to accomplish‚Äîwhat you want to be said of you to your family in the receiving line‚Äîit‚Äôs important to give your dreams the freedom to appear, exist, and be respected. Let them roam your mind as you explore where you want to go. Dreams may not dictate short-term decisions, but they help chart the longer course. There may even come that moment in your life when your dreams become real enough or lived enough to say, ‚ÄúWe are here. We finally made it.‚ÄùHow Do You Want to Be Remembered?For me, the picture of the end I envision is my wife and children at the mortuary not far from where we live. I delivered a newspaper early in the mornings to the mortuary office when I was a teenager, so it‚Äôs a familiar and friendly scene. (Well, as friendly as a mortuary can be to a fourteen-year-old on a moped in the dark.) Hopefully, it‚Äôs a sunny day so my wife isn‚Äôt cold, because she would be cold running wind sprints on the floor of an active volcano. The sun definitely needs to be bright and engaged in this photograph in my mind so she is warm and content. Plus, I won‚Äôt be there for her to tell me how cold she is.Ideally the service will be in the middle of the afternoon, so she can work most of the day at the elementary school where she teaches, take a short break for my service, and still get back home in time to watch Love Comes Softly or Love Comes Today or whatever is the most recent iteration of the exact same movie she has seen a trillion times on the Hallmark Channel. And, of course, the sooner the service ends, the sooner she can reach out to Matthew McConaughey on social media to let him know of her newfound availability.In my closing scene, I want it to be clear that I was a prosecutor, that I helped crime victims and their families fight for justice and accountability. I want people to think I was a loving husband to my wife and tried to be a good father to our children. This is the time for those who actually knew me‚Äînot the media, not my critics, not those who proliferate the comment sections of websites or social media posts‚Äîto say what they remember. I can think of nothing less credible than people who never met you or engaged with you describing your life to those who actually did know you. I hope people will say, ‚ÄúHe was funny and fair.‚Äù That would be a nice combination to leave with those I loved. It doesn‚Äôt matter to me whether anyone mentions Congress or not, although someone I met in Congress will be preaching the funeral. Likewise, it is not important to me that television or media be mentioned, although there is nothing in the world wrong with a career in the media, and I‚Äôm grateful for the job. It‚Äôs just that the courtroom is the job that meant the most to me, and therefore the one I hope others will remember.That final picture has the people who knew me best making my wife laugh with a memory or making her proud with a story. Funny and fair. That doesn‚Äôt sound overly ambitious, and, truth be told, that desired closing chapter or final picture may well have been different twenty years ago, before I understood the difference between who we are and what we do for a living. But it is settled now, and it likely won‚Äôt change at this point in my journey.What do you want people to say about you when you are gone? Where do you want to wind up, and what are you currently doing and deciding to make sure you make progress on that journey? Do you know yourself well enough to answer those questions today? Do you know yourself well enough to even ask those questions today?Your picture doesn‚Äôt have to include a funeral or service. It can be a retirement party or a hundredth birthday party or a seventy-fifth wedding anniversary. It‚Äôs not about the event. It‚Äôs about how you live on in the lives and memories of others, how you‚Äôve made an impact, and what you‚Äôve built with your life. You will be remembered by someone and for something. For how long and in what way is up to you. My hope is that our decisions can lead to a legacy that aligns with our dreams and intentions.It‚Äôs worth noting that your picture of the end may well evolve, as mine did, over time. Hopefully, as it changes and grows, there will be a general consistency or theme. As you begin living out your life, your end will hopefully become clearer and more defined. Yes, there will be curveballs and pitfalls. What we plan is not always what actually happens. We need to be capable of adapting, while still keeping our eyes on that end goal and picture.There is a Walmart near the home my wife and I have lived in for close to a quarter century. I frequented this Walmart quite a bit, especially when our kids were young. Our son loved LEGO sets and our daughter loved Barbie dolls and stuffed animals, so I spent lots of time in the toy section specifically. Every time I would haul my kids there to buy them more toys they didn‚Äôt need, we passed a greeter at the door. It was almost always the same greeter. Her name was Frankie, and she always had a story (usually with some length to it), always had some advice for me as a prosecutor, always had a piece of advice for law enforcement that I needed to pass on to the sheriff (preferably immediately), and sometimes had a bit of advice for Sam Walton (even though I repeatedly reminded her that I was not likely to bump into him along life‚Äôs highway).Frankie loved to talk and was always in a happy mood. I can almost guarantee the person you‚Äôre imagining right now, with the type of personality required to be a greeter at Walmart, is pretty accurate. Her liveliness and commentary consistently brought a smile to my face, and she slowly but surely taught me patience.Life moved on. My children grew older and their taste in toys became considerably more expensive. But there was always a reason I needed to go to Walmart, and Frankie was always there at the door. Until she wasn‚Äôt. She had been gone for about a week when, for a reason I don‚Äôt fully understand, I decided to look in a section of the local newspaper I rarely visit: the obituaries. There she was.My wife always has a sense of what the right thing to do is. She suggested the right thing to do was to go pay my respects at Frankie‚Äôs visitation. I did not even know Frankie‚Äôs last name until I read the obituary, and I certainly did not know anything about her family. But my wife said I should go, so I went. I drove to a small funeral home in a rural part of our county. There weren‚Äôt many cars in the lot, and there was no line, making me think I was at the wrong funeral home or had the wrong time. But I followed the signs down the hall and found the room with Frankie‚Äôs casket. There were only a handful of people standing around. No formalities. No service‚Äîor not that night at least. I paid my respects and left shortly thereafter. It struck me as sad that so few other people were there. I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting, but it was different from what I saw.I wish I had spoken to the people there that night. I wish I had talked about the way Frankie approached strangers with friendliness and humor, the way she built relationships in one-minute intervals as people were passing through what she called ‚Äúher door.‚Äù Her legacy influenced the way I view strangers and even the way I view small talk. It‚Äôs actually not always so ‚Äúsmall,‚Äù in hindsight, at least to those with whom you are talking. There are pearls of wisdom in the brief encounters we have in life, and there is never a wrong time to make others feel valued.The truth is, legacy lasts far beyond the words spoken or left unspoken at your funeral. Your closing argument isn‚Äôt just found in what people say‚Äîor how many speak up‚Äîabout you, but in how you made them feel. Frankie‚Äôs closing argument was built from the decision she made every day to show up with a smile, her decision to engage with people some might call strangers, and to remind them of the importance of slowing down and prioritizing human connection. She decided to try to make the world a better place the best way she knew how. She made people feel welcome, and that is one of the best feelings you can give someone.I still think of Frankie frequently when I pass a Walmart. I actually think of Frankie far more often than I do the man who started Walmart. Her memory reminds me to slow down, that it‚Äôs okay to smile from time to time and not always be in such a hurry. Life is not a hundred-meter dash. It‚Äôs okay to talk with the people we are walking this marathon with. I wonder how many other Walmart shoppers were impacted by Frankie the way I was. I bet if they knew she‚Äôd passed away, there would have been a larger crowd at the funeral home that night. But the size of the audience often does not equate to the quality of the performance.If you judge success by public adoration, media attention, fame, wealth, awards, or titles, then I guess Frankie would not be considered wildly successful. If, on the other hand, you measure life‚Äîthe accumulation of the decisions you make‚Äîaccording to the longevity and significance of what is remembered even by a few, then I would say Frankie is still alive and well.You cannot script with precision what‚Äôs going to happen in the end, but by thinking through what you want to be said of you, how you want to be remembered‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs said at your visitation or memorialized in a book years later‚Äîit will give you direction on whether to start, stay, or leave when you find yourself at a crossroads.The Note You End OnWhen writing the closing argument for that first murder trial, there were a number of different angles to choose from. We had hundreds of pieces of evidence. What did I want the jury to be left with? Would it be the fingerprint found in Ricky Samuel‚Äôs Bible? Would it be the symbolism of taking a man to accept Jesus and then putting two bullets in the back of his head, ensuring that he did, in fact, meet Jesus? Would it be the testimony of co-conspirators? Would it be the motive of wanting to eliminate a witness? How could we close this case in the most effective and persuasive way possible?I decided to end with a simple, single photograph of the crime scene.In this photograph, you had the benefit of simplicity, of imploring the jury to simply exercise its collective common sense. Picture the scene in your mind as it was depicted in this still photograph: A young man‚Äôs lifeless body lay mere feet away from a small pond with grass and trees on the periphery. The only evidence contained in that photograph was the body itself. The perpetrator was not in the photograph. The murder weapon was not in the photograph. But that photograph was powerful nonetheless. The loneliness was powerful. The inhumanity was powerful. The weakness of the federal government to protect its own witnesses was powerful.In this photograph there was a reflection off the water of that small pond. The surrounding grass and trees mirrored in that body of water. What if those actually were our witnesses? What if the grass and trees could testify? What would this photograph say if the photograph could speak to us?Indeed, it is speaking to us. It is telling us what happened if we will only listen. That photograph had the water needed for a manufactured baptism. It had the isolation needed for a crime. It had the anonymity someone not from the area would want and need. It had the absence of traditional witnesses. Photographs do not have failed recollections. They are the perfect distillation of a specific time and place. And in that regard, they are the best witnesses you could ever have.Who had the motive to kill Ricky Samuel? Who were the new faces in his life who could lure him to a small body of water miles removed from where he called home? Who did he trust enough to get into a car with and search for a proper baptismal pond? If you could rewind this photograph from when it was taken to when the image was actually created, who do you think would be there? Whose reflection would we see in the pond? And don‚Äôt you think the reflection from the pond belongs to the same person whose fingerprint was found in the book of Ezekiel?Since this was the first murder trial I had ever been part of, I experienced the raw and acute feelings of loss, finality, and loneliness attendant to homicide cases. Seasoned homicide investigators and litigators may eventually grow accustomed to these feelings, but they were brand-new for me, and more importantly, these feelings would be brand-new for the members of the jury. I knew that in order to win the case, I needed my closing argument to appeal to both logic and these raw emotions that would deeply resonate with the jury, the observers, the final decision makers. Throughout the trial, knowing I wanted to end with the photograph, I emphasized the inhumanity of the murder and the events preceding it, and I appealed to the humanity of the jury, empathizing with the emotions that the facts of the case conjured.Something terrible, tragic, and lethal happened by that pond, even if there was no one there to witness it. The absence of human perception does not obviate reality. A life was taken even if there was no one left among the living to tell us who did it.There are always questions at the end of a trial, no matter the amount of evidence produced. People are wired to ask questions. We are, in some ways, wired to see doubt both in ourselves and in others. The photograph allowed the jury to ask all the right questions as they were deliberating. And employing reason, probability, and common sense as they went through the evidence and the testimony would provide the answers to those questions.Bob Harry Fowler and Tommy Pabellon were convicted by a federal jury in Greenville, South Carolina, and given four life sentences for the murder for hire of federal witness Ricky Samuel. I have lost count of the number of homicide cases I prosecuted after Ricky Samuel‚Äôs. But I never lost sight of the tactic that worked, at least for me. Start at the end. What is the last point you want to make, and how can everything else you do and say empower you to make that argument?

## üîπ Key idea 2 of 6 <a name='key-idea-2'></a>

### ‚ú® There has to be more to life than simply looking and climbing up, not to mention the fact that the higher up the ladder you climb, the farther people get to see you fall.When I reflect on my friends who are contemplating running for the highest office in the land, or running for governor of a state, or whatever is perceived as the highest echelon of their chosen field, I feel the urge to ask them what I am asking you: Do you want the measure of what you accomplish in life to be marked by titles, offices, and achievements?


INTRODUCTIONDecisions, DecisionsI only remember two things from my wedding ceremony. I remember trying to take off my white gloves so my bride could slip the ring on my finger, even though she had told me no fewer than one thousand times she would slide it on over the glove. (Oh my heavens was she unamused.) The pain of that relatively poor decision did not last very long, though. It was the other thing that happened during the wedding that weighed on my mind for decades, and still does from time to time.At the end of the ceremony, our wonderful and dearly loved pastor said, ‚ÄúNow I present you with Mr. and Mrs. Trey Gowdy; he will be in the governor‚Äôs mansion one day, and she will be our first lady.‚Äù I was twenty-four years old, one week removed from taking the bar exam, and had not even had my first legal job. But the expectation was set. A lofty one. In front of all of our family, friends, and acquaintances in the church we grew up in. It was an expectation that I could not imagine reaching. I wish he had said, ‚ÄúTerri will be the governor one day, and Trey can be her first gentleman.‚Äù That I could get behind.On that day and for a season thereafter, I let someone else set the expectations for what my life should look like. Perhaps you would have viewed the comment as harmless fun, which it was. Perhaps you would have viewed it as a goal to shoot for and nothing more. I should have done that. But I did not. I let other people define what was success for too long in my life. And I spent many years chasing the fulfillment of other people‚Äôs expectations. This is not the only example of me allowing others to chart my course, but it is one I remember thirty years removed.‚ÄîSome people die trying to meet the expectations of others. It is a lifelong sentence they submit themselves to. I was on that path. So, I want to ask you a question. The one I should have asked myself a long time ago.What is the standard by which you judge a life to be well lived?Some believe life is defined by their work: their career path, how high they‚Äôve risen in a company, or how happy they are in their job. Others would measure the quality of their relationships with friends and family. For some, the pursuit of education and the unceasing craving for knowledge drive a meaningful life. Or maybe the photo sections of our phones or our photo albums are really what tell our stories, revealing who and what we treasure.For most of my life, I evaluated my significance by the type and quality of the work I did. I firmly believed that my life could be judged a ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù by others‚Äîif I could secure this job or master this set of responsibilities. Through work, so I thought, I could prove my value to the world.On those frequent days when the jobs, titles, and responsibilities did not match the expectations I had set‚Äîor let others set‚Äîfor myself, my fallback marker was my relationships. I could rely on success by association, since many of my friends were more noteworthy than I was.Admittedly, this is not an ideal way to navigate through life, but it is, candidly, how I operated for more than half of my existence.I have come to realize that there is something larger that binds a life together. There is an inherent link among the jobs you take and the ones you don‚Äôt, the people you befriend and the relationships you end, the schools you choose and the hobbies you pursue. Every one of those pursuits is initiated, nurtured, extended, or perhaps severed because of the decisions you make.If you believe life is primarily defined by your career paths, think of the myriad decisions that shape that road. You have to decide which field to go into. You have to decide where to apply for work and which offer to accept. You have to decide when it‚Äôs the right time to leave a job and when it‚Äôs better to stay.If you believe the essence of life is the relationships and friendships made, you have to make the decision to befriend someone else or make the decision to accept their offer of friendship. And for those relationships that we don‚Äôt actively choose‚Äîmothers, fathers, siblings, or our natural children‚Äîwe decide how intimate we are with them through the course of our lives.For those who conclude that life is what we learn, formally or otherwise, and how we educate ourselves, some decision precedes that bit of education: where to attend school, what to study, how hard to apply ourselves, what to study or read even after our formal education has ended.Decisions‚Äîthese invisible underpinnings are the subject of this book. They are the building blocks of life. They touch every area of your life and they chart your course. I have found that if you excel at the art of decision making, you will undoubtedly craft a well-lived life.I am not a psychologist or a career counselor. I am not a statistician or a fortune-teller. My only credentials are my half century‚Äôs worth of decisions made and not made, and the life that flowed from those decisions. I have placed some of the riskiest bets you can ever wager and I have succumbed to fear. I have won and I have lost. I have even lost by winning and won by losing. I have regrets and I have beautiful memories, and sometimes I have a hard time telling those two apart.Through it all, I found that the most consequential decisions in life boil down to three simple questions, which I‚Äôd like to share with you: Do I start? Do I stay? Or do I leave?‚ÄîExperience is a wonderful teacher; it‚Äôs just that the course takes so long. Oh, to be able to go back and make the decisions of early life using all the knowledge and (possibly) wisdom I have now! Sometimes I look back at my winding path to divine whether I ever had a plan, or if my life choices were simply a series of reactions. Did I choose my course or did I allow others‚Äîor, more accurately, my perception of their expectations‚Äîto make my decisions for me?I started working at the age of fourteen, delivering newspapers on a motorized bicycle at 5:00 A.M. Now, half a lifetime later, I deliver news on TV on Sunday nights and on podcasts on Tuesdays and Thursdays. You could argue that my life has been something of a circle, professionally speaking, although going to work at 7:00 P.M. in an indoor television studio is much better than starting my day at 5:00 A.M. on a moped being chased by dogs.How do you go from delivering the news to delivering the news and consider it a productive life? There were many, many decisions made along the way. Every one of my jobs, from paperboy to television host, was preceded by a decision to start a new job, to stay where I was, or to leave and, in turn, start the cycle again.During the paper route days, I concluded that I was neither a morning person nor a huge fan of dogs, especially those that could outrun a motorized scooter, so I left the paper route mornings and opted for an afternoon job bagging groceries at a local grocery store after high school classes ended. (Eggs and bread go on top of the canned vegetables and not beneath them, if you are wondering.) Most of my time was spent taking the groceries to customers‚Äô cars. My employer did not allow tipping, but there were some kind souls who defied that ‚Äúban on tipping‚Äù and I began to take note of the difference between ‚Äúrules‚Äù and mere ‚Äúsuggestions.‚ÄùAs a bag boy I learned that there is a part of each of us that covets advancement, or at least perceived advancement. It‚Äôs been forty years, but I still remember my pride when my then boss, Charlie Jones, told me he was going to ‚Äúpromote‚Äù me to cashier. I went home that day feeling like a million bucks. (This was before computerized cash registers told you the right amount of change to return to the customer. If only Charlie Jones had asked for my transcripts and seen my math grades, I never would have been ‚Äúpromoted.‚Äù Public speaking and live television are nothing compared to a customer giving you $2.15 when the cash register says $1.65 and expecting the right change back. I still sweat thinking of those moments.)During college, from 1982 to 1986, I worked in a warehouse filling tobacco orders. I learned more about life in that warehouse than I ever did inside a classroom or the halls of Congress. The decision to work four summers in a hot, unairconditioned building driving a forklift and pulling a cart was not based on my enjoyment of the work itself. It was purely transactional: I needed money. My father would not just give me cash, instead saying something about the intrinsic value of work, and so off I went to the warehouse. But forty years removed from that job, it remains one of my favorites. How could sweating all day trying to figure out the difference between Virginia Slims and Virginia Slims Light 100s be one of my favorite jobs? Because I loved the guys I was working with. That, in and of itself, was satisfying enough‚ÄîI decided to stay and prioritize who I worked with over what I did.I looked forward to getting up and going to work at the warehouse more than any other job I have had since. And I still find myself reflecting on two of the lessons learned during those sweaty summers: (1) who you travel the highways of life with is often more important than what road you are on; and (2) for many people, working in a warehouse for minimum wage, with a thirty-minute lunch break and no health insurance, is not simply a ‚Äúsummer job,‚Äù it is their job and the one by which they are trying to meet all the familial and societal responsibilities demanded of them.In college, I decided to major in history for all the wrong reasons, and then I went to law school, since my initial poorly conceived decision did not leave me with many options. After law school, I clerked for two judges: One judge was an appellate judge and the other was a trial judge. It was while working for the federal trial judge that I was lured to our criminal justice system, which is where I spent the majority of my professional life. I was an assistant United States attorney for six years and then ran for what South Carolina calls ‚Äúcircuit solicitor‚Äù and the rest of the country calls ‚Äúdistrict attorney.‚ÄùThe decision to leave the work I loved as a prosecutor and start a career in Congress in 2011 is a big part of this book, as is my decision to leave Congress in 2019. Yes, the kid who started his career as a paperboy reading about Congress while rolling newspapers in a gas station bathroom ended up as the chairman of a congressional committee, occasionally even making it into the newspapers himself. As it turned out, being in the newspaper wasn‚Äôt nearly as fulfilling as that fourteen-year-old kid thought it would be. I learned the hard way, as many people do, that fame is not the proper barometer for success or significance. People spend decades striving for fame or notoriety and then, once they taste it, often go running back toward anonymity as fast as their feet will take them.As you can see, I‚Äôve made a lot of decisions in life. Some seem unconventional or strange in hindsight. Some were influenced by outside forces, and some (usually later in life) were made with the self-confidence that can only come from defining terms like ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù and ‚Äúsignificance‚Äù in your own way. People might argue that some of my decisions have been backward steps or maybe even missteps. But, in the end, others do not get to define those terms in my life‚Äîor yours.What is important is that we understand what we have done, and why we have done it, and that, moving forward, we apply a method and purpose to our decision making. I have written this book in hopes that those decisions I have made‚Äîgood, bad, or indifferent‚Äîcan help you as you write your own book of life.‚ÄîHow well do you know yourself? To build the best version of your life that you can, you have to know yourself and have enough confidence in that self-knowledge to let it guide your decision making.Now consider: Where do you want to wind up? What is the desired destination? Are you traveling with a certain degree of speed or commitment? Do you need to stay on this road but with a few adjustments, maybe slow down or accelerate? Or do you need to find an exit and backtrack or head in a totally new direction?Starting anything new is both exciting and nerve-racking. Doubt can creep in. There will be critics and naysayers. But in this book, I will offer you ways to evaluate when to start something new, whether a job or a relationship, so that you can move forward with confidence and awareness. In the summer of 2021, I started a new television show. Starting the show meant leaving the practice of law full-time. But it also meant deciding what I wanted the show to be like. Is one night a week enough or should I shoot for more? Do I copy what has been successful for others in the cable realm or chart my own path? For that matter, what does success even mean in television? Is it viewers or ratings? Is it the quality of my writing or the diversity of my guests? The beauty of a start is that the canvas is unspoiled. But the season of starting does not last long. Pretty soon what began as a decision to start became a decision to stay.Staying may lack the excitement of starting something new, but often it is the wisest course. We must evaluate the decision to stay using many of the same metrics and tools as we do when evaluating whether to start in the first place. My wife and I have lived in the same town for nearly half a century and have lived in the same house for nearly a quarter of a century. We often debated over questions such as: Do we move closer to the media centers of the country? Do we move closer to where the largest law firms are? Do we move closer to the beach (although I do not really like sand)? Do we embark on the excitement of building a house rather than adjusting what the original builders had in mind? Ultimately, we decided to stay put for a reason that wouldn‚Äôt matter to any other couple. It was the trees. When my wife‚Äôs dad died, a friend in landscaping planted a tree in his honor in our front yard. He did the same thing when her mom died. And he did the same thing to honor our three dogs, Judge, Jury, and Bailiff‚Äîall of whom have gone. We stayed in a house for reasons that had nothing to do with the house. We traded the excitement of something new for the memories we could not live without.Finally, this book will look at the difficult decision of leaving‚Äîof how to know when the time and the circumstances are right to leave something or someone. Even when we obtain the things we are striving for, sometimes they wind up being less satisfying than what we anticipated. Sometimes a decision can be right for a season of life, but the seasons change‚Äîand so do we. I hope to give you tools to leave with confidence and no regrets.We both find ourselves in this sentence, in this paragraph of this book, based on decisions we made. I am grateful you have made the decision to read this far. You and I will both need to be brutally honest and search deep within ourselves as we embark on this book, making decisions that will lead to the most fulsome and consequential life possible.So, shall we start?

Start at the End¬†As you‚Äôre thinking about starting something‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a new career or a new relationship, a new hobby or a new investment, starting fresh in a new city or starting to get more serious about your health‚Äîwhatever it is, I have found it‚Äôs best to start at the end. By creating a clear picture in your mind of your final destination, you will be better equipped to make decisions that ensure you reach that desired place.¬†Writing the Closing ArgumentFederal murder cases are rare.Because people tend to equate ‚Äúfederal crime‚Äù with ‚Äúmore serious crime,‚Äù they are often surprised to learn that the vast majority of murder cases are prosecuted not in federal but in state court, tried by state prosecutors. Only certain categories of murder warrant jurisdiction in the federal system‚Äîsuch as the murder of a federal judge, the murder of a federal law enforcement officer in the line of duty, or the murder of a federal witness.Prior to 1995, there had been only one federal murder prosecution in twenty-five years in the Upstate of South Carolina. Our state is divided into four regions. There is the Low Country near the beach (think Charleston). There is the region called the Midlands, which is where our capital of Columbia is. There is the Pee Dee region, which is largely agricultural. And there is the Upstate, which is a region connecting Atlanta, Georgia, to Charlotte, North Carolina, along Interstate 85. That‚Äôs where I live and have worked, and the region I represented in Congress.Just once in a quarter century had there been a federal murder case in my home region. But there would soon be two. The second one involved the murder of one of my own witnesses. I had just turned thirty years old and was still early into my career as a federal prosecutor. I was in a courtroom in Anderson, South Carolina, long before the advent of cellphones. We used pagers back then and my pager was vibrating a lot while I was in court that day. You don‚Äôt look down at your pager while you are in federal court, so I waited for a break and what I saw was a series of 911 pages from law enforcement officers. I hurried back to the judge‚Äôs chambers, which were adjacent to the courtroom, to use the nearest landline. When I reached one of the federal agents who had been paging me, his response was immediate and direct: ‚ÄúRicky Samuel has been killed.‚ÄùRicky Samuel was a young man from Spartanburg, South Carolina, who had been in some relatively minor legal trouble, but he was trying to change the course of his life. His current challenge was a pending federal drug case. The drug amounts were small but, as you will soon learn, even a small amount of drugs can have a significant impact on your life. Ricky was lucky in that he had a mother who loved him very much and was tougher on him than the court system was ever going to be. He also had a new girlfriend, and the thought of going to federal prison for any period of time was not likely to enhance this new relationship. Ricky had a decision to make. He could serve several years in federal prison for narcotics dealing or he could try to reduce his exposure to prison time.The federal drug system works like this: There are mandatory minimum prison sentences for even relatively small amounts of drugs. Five grams of cocaine base, commonly referred to as crack cocaine, equaled a mandatory minimum five years in prison. Fifty grams of cocaine base equaled a mandatory minimum ten years in federal prison. A gram is the size of a packet of Truvia or Sweet‚ÄôN Low. Ricky was charged with possessing an ounce of cocaine base, and even by pleading guilty and fully accepting responsibility, he would have received more than five years in federal prison. There is no parole in federal court so he would have served the overwhelming majority of whatever sentence was imposed.The only way to reduce one‚Äôs exposure to prison time, once arrested or indicted, is to cooperate with the government and have the government petition the court for a shorter prison sentence at the time of the sentencing hearing. Cooperating with the government means providing historical information on who one‚Äôs drug suppliers were or who were the partners or co-conspirators in the drug ring. Cooperating could also include more active work such as wearing a wire during an undercover drug transaction. In fact, the most significant cuts to prison sentences were often reserved for those who took the most risks in cooperating with the government. Wearing a wire and conducting undercover drug transactions were risky.I had hundreds of conversations with young men, and a few women, who, like Ricky Samuel, had that choice to make: do the time or cooperate and deal with the consequences of being labeled a ‚Äúrat.‚ÄùThe federal agents and I laid out Ricky‚Äôs options for him and his mother, and Ricky made the decision to cooperate with federal law enforcement in their investigation of a large South Carolina narcotics trafficking ring with ties to Florida.In reality, it was not much of a decision. Prison would be hard for Ricky. He was small in stature and had a slightly deformed arm, which would have made self-defense, often a necessity there, harder for him. He was not violent; he was just another young man who stopped his education too soon for the lure of easy and fast money. We shared with him that there were risks associated with cooperation, much like the doctor who goes over the risks before giving a flu vaccine or having relatively minor surgery. Yes, there is a chance something bad will happen, but the chances are so small that they tend not to even register. Until they do.We asked Ricky to help us in our investigation into Tommy Pabellon. Pabellon was a drug dealer who had sold cocaine base in larger amounts than someone like Ricky Samuel. Law enforcement‚Äôs plan had Ricky, acting in an undercover capacity, purchase cocaine base from Pabellon. It would be what the cops call a ‚Äúbuy bust.‚Äù An informant, typically wearing an audio or video wire or both, buys drugs from a suspected dealer with marked money. The deal is set up via phone or pager and those conversations are recorded as well. A short time after the transaction is completed, the dealer is arrested and, more often than not, the marked money is in his possession. These cases are common and not particularly complicated. The evidence consists of the recorded calls setting up the transaction, video and audio surveillance of the transaction itself, and then the proceeds of whatever is on the suspect when the arrest is made.Ricky did what he was told to do. The undercover drug transaction went down exactly as planned. Pabellon sold Ricky the drugs and was arrested a short time later and a short distance away with the marked buy money in his pocket.Once Pabellon was arrested, he had the same opportunity Ricky Samuel and others had‚Äîplead guilty, go to trial, or cooperate and lessen his exposure to prison. Pabellon opted for trial, and before the trial date was reached, the government had to produce what is called discovery, which is all of the evidence the government has as it relates to the defendant. The government tries to keep the identity of any informants or cooperating witnesses concealed for as long as possible, but inevitably those names are disclosed to the defense counsel, and then in turn the defendants themselves learn the identity of the informants. The disclosure of witness names is always a nervous time for prosecutors and agents and the witnesses themselves. Some defense attorneys share portions of the discovery with their clients but not all of it, and some defense attorneys just drop off the packets of information at the jail and allow the client to peruse the information for themselves. More than once discovery from one case has been found in the jail cell of another inmate. News about cooperating witnesses travels fast.The disclosure of witness names is one part of the criminal justice system that vexes those outside the system and frustrates those inside the system, even though we understand why it is necessary. Defendants have a constitutional right to ‚Äúconfront‚Äù witnesses as well as the right to know what evidence exists and will be presented at trial. The Confrontation Clause is in our U.S. Constitution. Even children have to testify in the trials of those who abuse them, sitting alone in a witness chair surrounded by adult strangers, with the defendant, the person who hurt the child, positioning himself squarely in the line of sight of the child. Our system affords significant safeguards to those accused of crimes, and part of that is knowing who the witnesses will be against that particular defendant.It is a separate and serious crime to threaten or intimidate witnesses. But sometimes those already charged with violating the law show disregard for other parts of the law.Tommy Pabellon found out during the discovery process that Ricky Samuel was the informant in his case, and he believed that if Ricky was not around to testify at trial, there would be no case against him. Pabellon devised a plan with other co-conspirators in his drug ring to have Ricky killed, and he hired an out-of-state hit man named Bob Harry Fowler. Fowler came to Spartanburg, South Carolina, and posed as a neighborhood street preacher in an effort to gain Ricky‚Äôs trust, doing door-to-door ‚Äúevangelizing‚Äù in Ricky‚Äôs neighborhood. The plan worked. Over the course of a few weeks, Bob Harry Fowler developed a relationship with Ricky and then, under the guise of taking him to be baptized, Fowler lured him to a remote pond in a neighboring county where he had Ricky get on his knees to pray the ‚ÄúSinner‚Äôs Prayer‚Äù and accept Jesus as his Lord and Savior. Fowler then shot Ricky twice in the back of the head.Ricky Samuel‚Äôs body was later found where he had been executed, beside that small pond in rural Greenville County, with two bullet wounds to the head. He was executed in retaliation for providing assistance and information to federal law enforcement officials. He was killed in a failed attempt to make the drug case against Tommy Pabellon disappear. No key witness, no case. At least that is what Pabellon thought.When I arrived at the murder scene, my first thought was of Ricky‚Äôs mother, of how we‚Äîfederal agents and prosecutors alike‚Äîhad assured her that the government would do everything in its power to protect her son if he decided to provide us with information. It was of little solace that we had explained what could happen. What was thought to be exceedingly rare‚Äîthe harming of a federal witness‚Äîhad in fact happened. Ricky had entrusted us with his life, and his mother had entrusted us with her son, and we had failed them both.Law enforcement gathered a general description of the new ‚Äúevangelist‚Äù in Ricky‚Äôs life from his family and friends, but Fowler had given a false name and left town immediately after he killed Ricky. Luckily, the forensics team found a Bible in Ricky‚Äôs home that Fowler had given to him as part of his street preacher ruse, and a forensics technician painstakingly went through that Bible, page by page, looking for fingerprints. When he found one, on a page in the book of Ezekiel, we ran the fingerprint through a national database to see if there was a match in anyone‚Äôs criminal history file. Because the ‚Äúevangelist‚Äù had prior convictions in other states, there was a hit in the database.How did a fingerprint from a contract killer from Alabama get on a Bible in Ricky Samuel‚Äôs home in Spartanburg, South Carolina? Why did this ‚Äústreet preacher‚Äù leave town so quickly after Ricky was killed? Why did the man who spent so much time around Ricky in the days and weeks before his death not even bother to attend his funeral? Those were just a few of the questions the prosecutors would ask the jury to reflect on at trial.The investigation into Ricky Samuel‚Äôs murder was long and difficult. After Bob Harry Fowler was identified, he was located and arrested for murder. But we had to connect him to Tommy Pabellon, and neither Fowler nor Pabellon was talking.While agents were actively working on putting the pieces of the murder case together, I decided to do something else: I decided to prove to Tommy Pabellon just how wrong he was about whether he could be prosecuted even without Ricky Samuel. So off to trial we went, and Pabellon was convicted of the drug charge even without Ricky Samuel present as a witness. But he also needed to be held to account for the murder of a federal witness.Law enforcement wound up arresting Tommy Pabellon‚Äôs wife on other charges and she eventually provided evidence and testimony against Tommy. The real break came when one of Tommy‚Äôs co-conspirators in their drug ring decided to cooperate, just as Ricky had, in an effort to reduce the significant time he was facing for conspiracy to murder a federal witness. We interviewed this co-defendant, corroborated his version of events, and planned on using him as a witness in the trial. He would have been a powerful witness, implicating both himself and Pabellon in the murder-for-hire scheme. And then this witness hanged himself in a prison cell.Law enforcement agents and prosecutors have to work with the evidence they have. They do not get to create the evidence they want or need. Fowler and Pabellon had the motive to kill Ricky Samuel, and Fowler had the means and access to do so. But still the trial would be about connecting Fowler to Pabellon. Pabellon did not pull the trigger, but he was the reason the trigger was pulled.The late, great federal prosecutor David C. Stephens and I prosecuted the case together. Stephens told me early on in our preparation that I would be doing the closing argument. All parts of a criminal trial are important, from pretrial motions and jury selection all the way through to the charging of the jury and the deliberations. But the closing argument is the last chance prosecutors get to make their argument to the jury. It is considered supremely important. I had made some closing arguments before but never in a case of this magnitude. And so I began a practice that I came to use in every case I prepared, prosecuted, and tried afterward: I started at the end.I wrote the closing argument first, and then worked my way backward to the beginning of the trial. There were witnesses to be called and examined and cross-examined. There were legal arguments to be made and exhibits to be introduced. I structured the presentation of evidence to get me to my desired ending.The closing argument is last. But it is also most important. I started with what was most important and made sure everything else worked in tandem with that.Starting at the end helped me in that first murder case, and I used that strategy in every trial thereafter. Eventually I embraced the tactic outside the courtroom, and it became the framework I‚Äôve employed in every major life decision I‚Äôve faced since then. Start at the end and then figure out how to get there.The Last SceneOne of the joys of middle age is that sometimes young people mistake longevity for wisdom. As a result, I frequently have young people visit or call, looking for advice on their nascent careers. I let them talk first, and what I typically hear is a confession of uncertainty, anxiety, and apprehension. They are not quite sure what they want to do‚Äîor even who they want to be‚Äîbut someone, somewhere told them they needed to have life figured out at the tender age of seventeen. And the pressure begins to mount, at least in their minds. Sometimes these young people are worried about making money; sometimes they are worried about finding a fulfilling career path. Most are worried‚Äîsome are even paralyzed‚Äîby the fear of making the wrong decisions.I remember one young man who came to see me when I was in Congress. He had life all mapped out, but it required him to gain admittance to one of our military academies. If that did not happen, according to him, nothing else would happen and his life was essentially over (at the age of seventeen) because it all hinged on going to West Point or the Naval Academy. Put aside for a second just how incredibly competitive those schools are and how little control the applicants have over whether or not they are selected. I could not get over his deep belief that all of his hopes and dreams hinged on being accepted at one of two highly competitive and selective schools.My first response had nothing to do with how to gain admittance to a highly selective college or university. I simply asked him where he wanted to wind up. It turned out he wanted to wind up exactly where I was, which was in Congress. ‚ÄúWho told you going to Annapolis or West Point was a necessary condition to running for Congress?‚Äù I asked him. ‚ÄúAnd who told you that even graduating from West Point or Annapolis would guarantee electoral success? And how will that make you a more effective member of Congress even if you are successful in both?‚Äù The real question, I tried to convince him, is not where he would spend the next four years but an even deeper, more significant question. Where did he want to be for his last four years? What did his last four months looks like? Last four minutes? Without being moribund, I wanted him to lean back in that chair in my office, close his eyes, and visualize a picture. The picture I wanted him to paint, with the most vivid details he could conjure, is the final scene.You can do the same.You‚Äôve passed from this world, hopefully after a long, happy, and healthy life, and family and close friends are waiting in a line to receive visitors. There is no more chance to leave a mark, make amends, rethink a decision, or change the story. Imagine the closing argument for your own life.When you think of that funeral scene, place yourself in that room eavesdropping on the conversations. If you see yourself as an angel, that‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt think I will qualify for that title, so I will go with just a spirit or a ghostlike figure lurking above the receiving line, but I want you to answer two questions:What have you accomplished?How are you remembered?Considering what people might say about them at their funeral usually snaps my young visitors to attention. (Or scares them away.) No one really enjoys thinking about the end. It‚Äôs hard and final, and it is understandable that we would rather dwell on happier thoughts. But death is one of the few things that is absolutely guaranteed in our lives, so these are important questions to ask, despite the uncomfortableness of it all. We have to will ourselves to do it‚Äîto think about the closing argument of life so we can structure the evidence and pick the witnesses who will testify about our lives. If life can be compared to a trial and if there is a final argument, a closing statement of sorts, what will be said and is there evidence to support it?The truth is, for many young adults figuring out what they want to do after they turn eighteen, their decisions revolve around vocation. What career field do they want to enter when they graduate? I try to encourage them to think of the other areas of their lives as well. What we seek to accomplish in life, in my judgment, should not be confined to a single area but should span relational, vocational, educational, and personal realms.We are human, of course, and a perfect balance is impossible, but thinking through how the various areas of life co-exist with one another helps give us better direction. If you make a lot of money but have no time for family, will you have accomplished what you want in life? If you are singularly focused on socializing in college and neglect your studies, are you setting yourself up to accomplish everything you want to achieve? All friends and no job is sort of like ‚Äúall hat and no cattle.‚ÄùAt any age, focusing on what we want to accomplish in a variety of areas will help give us that holistic picture as we move through life. When we decide to look at life through the lens of what we want to accomplish rather than simply what we want to do, life gains the significance we covet and our decision making will gain a sense of purpose.I wish I had a nickel for every young person who told me they wanted to make a difference in their community, their state, or their nation. Their motives were pure, near as I could tell. They really wanted to effectuate change. So, I listened and nodded my head as they explained to me why they needed to go to law school, and then go into politics or government, in order to bring about that change our society so desperately needed. And when it was my time to offer advice, it was always the same advice: If you want to change the world, you should teach.Teachers have changed my life more than any United States president or cabinet member. The person I live with, a first-grade teacher, will change the world more in one semester than I did in eight years in the House of Representatives.The prestige of what you do and the importance of what you accomplish are two entirely different things. The sooner we learn that truth, the more fulfilling life will be. If you are going to make the very best decisions in life, you are going to have to be honest with yourself. We all try to say the right things when others are listening. Say the honest thing when it is just you doing the talking and listening. I encourage these young people I have the good fortune to visit with to have a frank conversation with themselves about their real motivations as they relate to the decisions before them.Now, having a clear vision of the end is essential, but the actions you take to bring that image to life are what will determine whether you reach your desired destination. This is one case where it is not merely the thought that counts. You build your closing argument with the daily decisions you make. How you speak to people, how you make others feel, how you conduct your business, how well you take care of yourself and those you love, how much you help those in need, how generous you are with your time or money‚Äîall that is evidence that will be used and relied upon for your own closing argument in life.The things you think, do, and say each day are leading you to your final destination. Your decisions, wittingly or unwittingly made, will guide you somewhere, so I would encourage you not to keep that desired destination a secret‚Äîespecially from yourself. Put another way, the more you think about your closing argument now, the more likely you will be able to shape it between now and when folks put on their Sunday best to bid you farewell.And if we want to make the decisions that lead us to our desired closing arguments, we need to evaluate where we are now‚Äîas in today, the very moment you read this. If you need to change direction or the speed with which you are moving, now is the perfect time to analyze that. Are you happy in your career, school, major, key relationships? When you consider the big things like vocation, family, friendships, business relationships, and marriage, are you on track for your desired closing argument?What Do You Want to Accomplish?There is a tremendous difference between what we ‚Äúdo‚Äù and what we ‚Äúaccomplish.‚Äù Accomplishing something requires intent and purpose. Accomplishing something requires foresight of the ending. When we work toward accomplishing something, we have direction; if we are merely doing something, we are moving without direction, and we are more likely to get lost.For example, when I was considering college majors, I looked at what I needed to do to graduate, which was accrue 120 credit hours, rather than what I wanted to accomplish in life. I chose history because I went to college with six hours of Advanced Placement credit in history from high school, and that credit reduced the number of classes I needed for the major.I would have been much better off, in hindsight, majoring in philosophy so I could learn to think more critically or psychology so I could understand human nature. Thinking critically and understanding human nature are essential to helping people who have been the victims of crime, which is what ultimately wound up being what I wanted to accomplish in life.But still, I found a way to make it work because there are multiple routes to get to a destination. Some poor decisions cost you a lot, and some cost you next to nothing. I majored in history and wound up going to law school and ultimately found a career in the justice system that I loved. Even though I would have done college differently if given the chance, I eventually made sense of the path I chose and got to my destination despite the fact that the path was more circuitous than it needed to be.You are not ‚Äúfinished,‚Äù as that young man tried to convince me, if you don‚Äôt get into an elite military school. Your life is not ‚Äúover‚Äù because you didn‚Äôt get your dream job. You are not free to ‚Äúgive up‚Äù because you did not get an invitation to join this group or club. One misguided decision or unexpected setback might stop you from doing something specific, but it does not hinder you from accomplishing what you want to in life; it might just take you a little longer to get there. All routes may not be equal in length, difficulty, or scenery, but they can get you where you want to be if you are clear on your destination and dogged in your pursuit.Do not forget to consult your dreams. Usually when I ask young people what they hope to accomplish, I can see their eyes light up as they think about what some call dreams and others call goals or aspirations. Some of these young people are reluctant to verbalize those dreams for fear they will be perceived as too wild, fanciful, or unattainable. I am the first one to tell you that logic has a role in decision making. But it is essential and liberating to verbalize what we dream to be or¬†do.Logic and dreams can be roommates. They can be travel companions. That will be a recurring thread throughout this book (although some of the decisions I‚Äôve made in life may seem to indicate that logic was taking a nap while my dreams drove the car). Logic will and should take the lead. But when forming your image of the end and thinking through what you want to accomplish‚Äîwhat you want to be said of you to your family in the receiving line‚Äîit‚Äôs important to give your dreams the freedom to appear, exist, and be respected. Let them roam your mind as you explore where you want to go. Dreams may not dictate short-term decisions, but they help chart the longer course. There may even come that moment in your life when your dreams become real enough or lived enough to say, ‚ÄúWe are here. We finally made it.‚ÄùHow Do You Want to Be Remembered?For me, the picture of the end I envision is my wife and children at the mortuary not far from where we live. I delivered a newspaper early in the mornings to the mortuary office when I was a teenager, so it‚Äôs a familiar and friendly scene. (Well, as friendly as a mortuary can be to a fourteen-year-old on a moped in the dark.) Hopefully, it‚Äôs a sunny day so my wife isn‚Äôt cold, because she would be cold running wind sprints on the floor of an active volcano. The sun definitely needs to be bright and engaged in this photograph in my mind so she is warm and content. Plus, I won‚Äôt be there for her to tell me how cold she is.Ideally the service will be in the middle of the afternoon, so she can work most of the day at the elementary school where she teaches, take a short break for my service, and still get back home in time to watch Love Comes Softly or Love Comes Today or whatever is the most recent iteration of the exact same movie she has seen a trillion times on the Hallmark Channel. And, of course, the sooner the service ends, the sooner she can reach out to Matthew McConaughey on social media to let him know of her newfound availability.In my closing scene, I want it to be clear that I was a prosecutor, that I helped crime victims and their families fight for justice and accountability. I want people to think I was a loving husband to my wife and tried to be a good father to our children. This is the time for those who actually knew me‚Äînot the media, not my critics, not those who proliferate the comment sections of websites or social media posts‚Äîto say what they remember. I can think of nothing less credible than people who never met you or engaged with you describing your life to those who actually did know you. I hope people will say, ‚ÄúHe was funny and fair.‚Äù That would be a nice combination to leave with those I loved. It doesn‚Äôt matter to me whether anyone mentions Congress or not, although someone I met in Congress will be preaching the funeral. Likewise, it is not important to me that television or media be mentioned, although there is nothing in the world wrong with a career in the media, and I‚Äôm grateful for the job. It‚Äôs just that the courtroom is the job that meant the most to me, and therefore the one I hope others will remember.That final picture has the people who knew me best making my wife laugh with a memory or making her proud with a story. Funny and fair. That doesn‚Äôt sound overly ambitious, and, truth be told, that desired closing chapter or final picture may well have been different twenty years ago, before I understood the difference between who we are and what we do for a living. But it is settled now, and it likely won‚Äôt change at this point in my journey.What do you want people to say about you when you are gone? Where do you want to wind up, and what are you currently doing and deciding to make sure you make progress on that journey? Do you know yourself well enough to answer those questions today? Do you know yourself well enough to even ask those questions today?Your picture doesn‚Äôt have to include a funeral or service. It can be a retirement party or a hundredth birthday party or a seventy-fifth wedding anniversary. It‚Äôs not about the event. It‚Äôs about how you live on in the lives and memories of others, how you‚Äôve made an impact, and what you‚Äôve built with your life. You will be remembered by someone and for something. For how long and in what way is up to you. My hope is that our decisions can lead to a legacy that aligns with our dreams and intentions.It‚Äôs worth noting that your picture of the end may well evolve, as mine did, over time. Hopefully, as it changes and grows, there will be a general consistency or theme. As you begin living out your life, your end will hopefully become clearer and more defined. Yes, there will be curveballs and pitfalls. What we plan is not always what actually happens. We need to be capable of adapting, while still keeping our eyes on that end goal and picture.There is a Walmart near the home my wife and I have lived in for close to a quarter century. I frequented this Walmart quite a bit, especially when our kids were young. Our son loved LEGO sets and our daughter loved Barbie dolls and stuffed animals, so I spent lots of time in the toy section specifically. Every time I would haul my kids there to buy them more toys they didn‚Äôt need, we passed a greeter at the door. It was almost always the same greeter. Her name was Frankie, and she always had a story (usually with some length to it), always had some advice for me as a prosecutor, always had a piece of advice for law enforcement that I needed to pass on to the sheriff (preferably immediately), and sometimes had a bit of advice for Sam Walton (even though I repeatedly reminded her that I was not likely to bump into him along life‚Äôs highway).Frankie loved to talk and was always in a happy mood. I can almost guarantee the person you‚Äôre imagining right now, with the type of personality required to be a greeter at Walmart, is pretty accurate. Her liveliness and commentary consistently brought a smile to my face, and she slowly but surely taught me patience.Life moved on. My children grew older and their taste in toys became considerably more expensive. But there was always a reason I needed to go to Walmart, and Frankie was always there at the door. Until she wasn‚Äôt. She had been gone for about a week when, for a reason I don‚Äôt fully understand, I decided to look in a section of the local newspaper I rarely visit: the obituaries. There she was.My wife always has a sense of what the right thing to do is. She suggested the right thing to do was to go pay my respects at Frankie‚Äôs visitation. I did not even know Frankie‚Äôs last name until I read the obituary, and I certainly did not know anything about her family. But my wife said I should go, so I went. I drove to a small funeral home in a rural part of our county. There weren‚Äôt many cars in the lot, and there was no line, making me think I was at the wrong funeral home or had the wrong time. But I followed the signs down the hall and found the room with Frankie‚Äôs casket. There were only a handful of people standing around. No formalities. No service‚Äîor not that night at least. I paid my respects and left shortly thereafter. It struck me as sad that so few other people were there. I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting, but it was different from what I saw.I wish I had spoken to the people there that night. I wish I had talked about the way Frankie approached strangers with friendliness and humor, the way she built relationships in one-minute intervals as people were passing through what she called ‚Äúher door.‚Äù Her legacy influenced the way I view strangers and even the way I view small talk. It‚Äôs actually not always so ‚Äúsmall,‚Äù in hindsight, at least to those with whom you are talking. There are pearls of wisdom in the brief encounters we have in life, and there is never a wrong time to make others feel valued.The truth is, legacy lasts far beyond the words spoken or left unspoken at your funeral. Your closing argument isn‚Äôt just found in what people say‚Äîor how many speak up‚Äîabout you, but in how you made them feel. Frankie‚Äôs closing argument was built from the decision she made every day to show up with a smile, her decision to engage with people some might call strangers, and to remind them of the importance of slowing down and prioritizing human connection. She decided to try to make the world a better place the best way she knew how. She made people feel welcome, and that is one of the best feelings you can give someone.I still think of Frankie frequently when I pass a Walmart. I actually think of Frankie far more often than I do the man who started Walmart. Her memory reminds me to slow down, that it‚Äôs okay to smile from time to time and not always be in such a hurry. Life is not a hundred-meter dash. It‚Äôs okay to talk with the people we are walking this marathon with. I wonder how many other Walmart shoppers were impacted by Frankie the way I was. I bet if they knew she‚Äôd passed away, there would have been a larger crowd at the funeral home that night. But the size of the audience often does not equate to the quality of the performance.If you judge success by public adoration, media attention, fame, wealth, awards, or titles, then I guess Frankie would not be considered wildly successful. If, on the other hand, you measure life‚Äîthe accumulation of the decisions you make‚Äîaccording to the longevity and significance of what is remembered even by a few, then I would say Frankie is still alive and well.You cannot script with precision what‚Äôs going to happen in the end, but by thinking through what you want to be said of you, how you want to be remembered‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs said at your visitation or memorialized in a book years later‚Äîit will give you direction on whether to start, stay, or leave when you find yourself at a crossroads.The Note You End OnWhen writing the closing argument for that first murder trial, there were a number of different angles to choose from. We had hundreds of pieces of evidence. What did I want the jury to be left with? Would it be the fingerprint found in Ricky Samuel‚Äôs Bible? Would it be the symbolism of taking a man to accept Jesus and then putting two bullets in the back of his head, ensuring that he did, in fact, meet Jesus? Would it be the testimony of co-conspirators? Would it be the motive of wanting to eliminate a witness? How could we close this case in the most effective and persuasive way possible?I decided to end with a simple, single photograph of the crime scene.In this photograph, you had the benefit of simplicity, of imploring the jury to simply exercise its collective common sense. Picture the scene in your mind as it was depicted in this still photograph: A young man‚Äôs lifeless body lay mere feet away from a small pond with grass and trees on the periphery. The only evidence contained in that photograph was the body itself. The perpetrator was not in the photograph. The murder weapon was not in the photograph. But that photograph was powerful nonetheless. The loneliness was powerful. The inhumanity was powerful. The weakness of the federal government to protect its own witnesses was powerful.In this photograph there was a reflection off the water of that small pond. The surrounding grass and trees mirrored in that body of water. What if those actually were our witnesses? What if the grass and trees could testify? What would this photograph say if the photograph could speak to us?Indeed, it is speaking to us. It is telling us what happened if we will only listen. That photograph had the water needed for a manufactured baptism. It had the isolation needed for a crime. It had the anonymity someone not from the area would want and need. It had the absence of traditional witnesses. Photographs do not have failed recollections. They are the perfect distillation of a specific time and place. And in that regard, they are the best witnesses you could ever have.Who had the motive to kill Ricky Samuel? Who were the new faces in his life who could lure him to a small body of water miles removed from where he called home? Who did he trust enough to get into a car with and search for a proper baptismal pond? If you could rewind this photograph from when it was taken to when the image was actually created, who do you think would be there? Whose reflection would we see in the pond? And don‚Äôt you think the reflection from the pond belongs to the same person whose fingerprint was found in the book of Ezekiel?Since this was the first murder trial I had ever been part of, I experienced the raw and acute feelings of loss, finality, and loneliness attendant to homicide cases. Seasoned homicide investigators and litigators may eventually grow accustomed to these feelings, but they were brand-new for me, and more importantly, these feelings would be brand-new for the members of the jury. I knew that in order to win the case, I needed my closing argument to appeal to both logic and these raw emotions that would deeply resonate with the jury, the observers, the final decision makers. Throughout the trial, knowing I wanted to end with the photograph, I emphasized the inhumanity of the murder and the events preceding it, and I appealed to the humanity of the jury, empathizing with the emotions that the facts of the case conjured.Something terrible, tragic, and lethal happened by that pond, even if there was no one there to witness it. The absence of human perception does not obviate reality. A life was taken even if there was no one left among the living to tell us who did it.There are always questions at the end of a trial, no matter the amount of evidence produced. People are wired to ask questions. We are, in some ways, wired to see doubt both in ourselves and in others. The photograph allowed the jury to ask all the right questions as they were deliberating. And employing reason, probability, and common sense as they went through the evidence and the testimony would provide the answers to those questions.Bob Harry Fowler and Tommy Pabellon were convicted by a federal jury in Greenville, South Carolina, and given four life sentences for the murder for hire of federal witness Ricky Samuel. I have lost count of the number of homicide cases I prosecuted after Ricky Samuel‚Äôs. But I never lost sight of the tactic that worked, at least for me. Start at the end. What is the last point you want to make, and how can everything else you do and say empower you to make that argument?

Look in the Mirror¬†Your decisions in life will determine your success. But first, your most important decision will determine what success looks like in your life. Define success in terms of what you can control‚Äîyour words, your mindset, your effort. The small decisions we make every day matter: choosing to use respectful language when you get in an argument with your boss, deciding that you are going to be optimistic about the outcomes of the projects you are working on, opting to read this book rather than watch TV, planning to go on dates with or give gifts to your significant other to show you care. When you decide to control your daily actions, you can derive your sense of fulfillment from active choices you make rather than only outcomes, a more stable and sustainable way of approaching success.¬†Pyramids and Tall OrdersWhen I was growing up, my father would regale my three sisters and me with stories about Judge Donald S. Russell, the man for whom the federal courthouse in my hometown of Spartanburg, South Carolina, is named. Judge Russell was someone I admired in large part because of his extraordinary r√©sum√©. I met Judge Russell only once, so it was his known accomplishments that I was most familiar with. He was the governor of the state of South Carolina, the president of the University of South Carolina, a United States senator, a United States district court judge, and a judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, to name just a few.My dad‚Äôs favorite Donald Russell story was that on Saturdays in the fall, Judge Russell would ride from Spartanburg to Columbia with his family for University of South Carolina football games. Once in Columbia, the family would drop Judge Russell off at a library or a park so he could read while the rest of the family went to the football game. Talk about misplaced priorities! Who would possibly pass up a chance to watch a Gamecocks football game to go read yet another book?I think the obvious point of my father‚Äôs story was that Judge Russell highly valued education, both formal and otherwise. The point could also have been that South Carolina was not very good at football back then, so Judge Russell found the library or a park bench more entertaining. If Judge Russell could still value education and reading, even at that point in life, having accomplished all that he had accomplished, surely I would be wise to value it more during my formative years. Education was not a target for Judge Russell‚Äîit was his process. It was not merely something to be obtained‚Äîit was something to be experienced. I understood full well the point of my father‚Äôs story. I just did not apply those lessons to my own life‚Äînot then, at least.For a long time, Judge Russell‚Äôs r√©sum√© and reputation set the standard for what I believed a successful life should look like. I should accumulate one professional accomplishment piled on top of another‚Äîeach step narrowing the path until some pinnacle is reached. Life is a pyramid and the goal is to get to the very top. That is what he had done and that is what I should strive for.The pyramid model of success goes something like this: You are born on the bottom of the pyramid. Most of us are expected to do certain things like graduate high school or avoid interactions with the criminal justice system. For those ‚Äúaccomplishments‚Äù you receive no credit, save that your pyramid remains largely intact. This is the base of the pyramid; it does not distinguish you from others‚Äîit simply keeps you in the game, like the opening ante in a poker match.From there on, each of your decisions becomes a building block in the pyramid, narrowing your path and scaling the heights even as the walk becomes more precarious as you go. Your vocational pursuits become steps toward the top‚Äîeach promotion elevating and distinguishing you even more. Any awards and recognition you receive during your life will help to build your pyramid, separating you from others who may have similar career paths and goals. Finally, at the top of the pyramid is a lasting legacy, a reputation that lives on even after you‚Äôre gone, like having a courthouse named after you. To reach the top of the pyramid is to achieve uniqueness in the purest sense of the word. It indicates that you have done or accomplished things that have not been duplicated by others.Based partly on Judge Russell‚Äôs example, growing up‚Äîand well into adulthood‚ÄîI‚Äôd ask myself: What does the top of my pyramid look like? How am I going to distinguish myself? How many things have I done that others may not have done? I thought I could prove my uniqueness only by doing things others viewed as laudatory or exceptional. It was an exhausting way to go through life.The education part of my pyramid was pretty thin and flimsy. I remember getting the yearbook my senior year of high school. There was a page dedicated to the ‚ÄúTen Most Outstanding Seniors,‚Äù the students who had stood out the most academically, athletically, and otherwise. You will not find my name on that page of our high school yearbook‚Äîor any other page, for that matter, aside from the obligatory class photo, which is sort of tantamount to a participation award. Though I tried to carve out some semblance of a significant existence, my desire for success was overwhelmed by my fear of failure. It‚Äôs really hard to achieve much of note if you never venture or try. Part of you says to go for it, while the rest of you says you will likely fail. And the result was what I perceived as nothingness: no impact, nothing to distinguish myself by. When I received that yearbook in homeroom, I turned through the pages and I saw failure. Anonymity and failure.Our son graduated from the same high school I graduated from about thirty years after I did, and there he was on the page of ‚ÄúOutstanding Seniors.‚Äù The base of his pyramid was already looking different from and much better than his father‚Äôs. But he eschewed that definition of success in life. I doubt he even opened his yearbook, and if he did, I can safely assure you it was not to judge whether he achieved high school fame. Even though he accomplished far more than his father had by that stage, it was inconsequential to him. He, smartly, does not use a pyramid to define a successful life, nor does he allow the editors of a high school annual to determine his worth.But I did then, and I did even after high school. Life went on, and I viewed every new day as just another opportunity to distinguish my existence from that of others. I determined that what I had not accomplished with my decision making in high school and college, I would have to make up for with subsequent decisions. I clerked for a district court judge. Some other people did that too, but not all other people. Then it was off to the United States Attorney‚Äôs Office. There have also been plenty of women and men who clerked for federal judges and went on to become federal prosecutors, but the pyramid was at least getting thinner in my mind. Add to that running for political office, first as state district attorney and later in Congress. With each new endeavor, I was trying to add points of differentiation or distinction that to outsiders would make my pyramid look like a life well spent.Looking at the top of the pyramid may sound like a less morbid way to picture the end than thinking of the receiving line or wake preceding your funeral. You might say it‚Äôs just another way to start with the end goal in mind. But I have found the pyramid to be a faulty model. If you live your life in an effort to be distinct from everyone else, you will live for an external title or reputation rather than an internal purpose or aspiration. You will be relegated to a narrow path. What would life look like if we accepted our uniqueness from the beginning and stopped trying to prove it?Often life handcuffs us with a definition of ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù imprinted in our youth, and we can never seem to outrun it. For me, this pyramid, combined with an innate fear of failure, set an unattainable and exhausting definition for a well-lived life. But for years I couldn‚Äôt shake it. While I don‚Äôt blame the honorable Judge Russell for my unrealistic benchmark for success, his expansive r√©sum√© and substantial reputation left me feeling substandard and inadequate no matter my age or what I actually did achieve.Climbing LaddersAnother popular model of success is a ladder, with every rung representing incremental achievements and increasing power or worth. The ladder is a metaphor typically used to describe professional achievements‚Äîas you get promoted, you continue to climb. It‚Äôs commonly referred to, not surprisingly, as ‚Äúclimbing the ladder of success.‚ÄùI have a few friends who see success according to the ladder model, and some of those people have their sights set on the very top rung of the ladder, as in the most powerful position in the country and, arguably, the world: president of the United States of America.According to the best estimates, 545 million people have been born in or moved to the United States of America since we became a country. There have been forty-six presidencies in that time period, with forty-five different men (for now) having held that position. (As you may recall, Grover Cleveland was president twice but not successively, so we will count him once.)Based on firsthand knowledge alone, I can currently think of no fewer than twenty-five women and men who are considering a run for president in 2024 or beyond. Even more, there are 100 United States senators, 50 governors, 435 members of the House of Representatives, and dozens of ambassadors and cabinet-level officials. It is safe to assume that many of them aspire to be president. And then there are the entertainers, television commentators, radio talk show hosts, and others who believe that they, too, would make a fine leader of the free world.So a lot of people aspire to‚Äîand perhaps even define success as having‚Äîa job where the chances of ‚Äúbeing hired‚Äù are less than the odds of winning the Mega Millions lottery or, to put it more pointedly, being struck by lightning while cashing in your winning lottery ticket.The ladder model is dependent upon outperforming and outachieving other people. First, that‚Äôs not always possible, and second, that leaves a lot of people behind or falling off. All of those aspiring presidents will not be ‚Äúunsuccessful‚Äù in their lives simply because they do not achieve something incredibly difficult to achieve. There must be worth and purpose somewhere besides the top rung of this ladder. There has to be more to life than simply looking and climbing up, not to mention the fact that the higher up the ladder you climb, the farther people get to see you fall.When I reflect on my friends who are contemplating running for the highest office in the land, or running for governor of a state, or whatever is perceived as the highest echelon of their chosen field, I feel the urge to ask them what I am asking you: Do you want the measure of what you accomplish in life to be marked by titles, offices, and achievements? Or do you want what you accomplish in life to be defined by the fight itself, the venture, the challenges, the pursuits that you deemed worthy of your time? Is success what you do or who you are?Of my current friends who look in a mirror and see a potential president of the United States, perhaps one, if he or she is lucky, will ever ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù in my lifetime. Most of them will not even be the nominee of their political party. But that cannot possibly mean that these women and men are failures. My hope for them, and for you, is that they will consider themselves a smashing success simply because they ventured, they tried, and they competed.It‚Äôs a matter of perspective. So, if we can find a way to shift our identity from what we have achieved to what we have ventured to do, then we can begin to make better decisions for ourselves. And if we are able to shift our identity‚Äîthe measure of our own worth‚Äîfrom what we have ventured to do to who we have ventured to become, not in terms of title but in terms of character, then we are able to view success not from the top of a ladder but from the throngs of a fulfilled life, surrounded by friends and family and full of aspirations, ventures, and careers we loved.You can fall off a ladder or a pyramid. Interestingly, the higher you have scaled it, the more painful the fall. Both perspectives on success make shifts in direction seem akin to failure. If you decide to change paths, both models imply that all the work up to that point has been pointless and you are starting at the bottom again. If you decide ten years into your career in insurance that you want to be a romance writer, then you will go back to ground zero‚Äîlike a terrible game of real-life Chutes and Ladders.I would encourage you to eschew both the pyramid and the ladder for something much more likely to get you to your desired closing photograph and summation.Man in the MirrorIn 2015, during my third term in Congress, there was a window of opportunity for me to run for the Speaker of the House of Representatives. There was a path, albeit small, to victory. John Boehner was stepping down. Kevin McCarthy, the clear favorite, had withdrawn from consideration. Paul Ryan was being cajoled to run, but his real desire was to stay where he was as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. So, there was this highly coveted title, with no perceived front-runner, and hence there was a path. That would have certainly helped me build the next level of my pyramid: Speaker of the House, third in line to the president. It might even make up for not appearing on the Outstanding Seniors page of the high school yearbook.Should I start or should I stay? Should I run for a position that presents itself infrequently, if ever? Should I seize that moment to do something no one ever thought me capable of doing? Should I shock every teacher I ever had? Could I forgive myself if I had a life-changing opportunity within arm‚Äôs reach and then decided to withdraw my arm? The pyramid mentality said, ‚ÄúStart. Go for it.‚ÄùBut by that point, I had thankfully traded the lure of a unique pyramid for the steady assurance of a mirror. I no longer felt the need to be different or successful in the eyes of everyone else. I no longer needed a title to set me apart. I simply felt the need to be successful in the eyes of a few, and mostly in my own eyes when I looked in the mirror.It is hard to pinpoint the precise moment I scaled this mountain of change and swapped my external calibration of success for an internal one. From an early age I confused what I did with who I was. I confused what I accomplished or failed to accomplish with my sense of worth. Ironically, I did not do this to others. One of the kindest things I ever heard my father say about me was, ‚ÄúTrey treats the man who owns the building the same way he does the man who cleans the building.‚Äù And my dad was right‚ÄîI did try to do that with almost everyone. Except myself.Once you accept that there is at least one person in the world who genuinely does not care whether you work in the Capitol or manicure the lawns around the Capitol, you can be freed. You can be liberated. That one person for me is my wife, Terri. Throughout our life together and because of the love she‚Äôs shown me, I was able to distance myself from the pyramid model I‚Äôd always subscribed to. I jokingly say that I am not even sure my wife knew I was in Congress for eight years. It‚Äôs just not how she judges me or my worth to her or our children. For her it is your character, not your accomplishments. It is how you act, not what you achieve. Attention and notoriety never meant anything to her. The two men she respected most in life were her father and her brother, and it was not because of anything either of them did, it was because of who they were. It is liberating when you find someone who values you for who you are rather than what you accomplish. And it is even more liberating when you finally begin to listen to that person.It is most liberating when you become that someone for yourself.I went from scaling the pyramid to looking in the mirror when Terri handed me the keys that let me out of that self-styled prison. Someone else can unlock the door of that prison, but you must affirmatively decide to walk out and leave. It‚Äôs not that I didn‚Äôt care anymore about what others thought of me. I did care, to a point. But I was no longer a prisoner of what others thought. I have accepted that my pyramid will look pretty much like everyone else‚Äôs when my time is called. Even if it were distinct, I‚Äôve realized that few people who matter would notice or care.The path of my life no longer needs to be an ascent for me to define it as successful. I now look in the mirror (metaphorically‚Äîyou don‚Äôt get a hairdo like mine by spending a ton of time in front of a mirror) and ask myself: Will I be making this decision for myself or for others? Will this cause a rift in the relationships and things that bring me joy in life? Will I see my family less or not be able to play golf with my son and my friends as often? Does this decision take me on a path that leads me closer to my desired closing argument, to that final photograph in life‚Äôs pictorial? Will I enjoy and find purpose in the reality of this decision (the day-to-day work) or just the concept of it (the title and prestige)?In the case of my opportunity to run for Speaker of the House, when I had the chance to start something new, my mirror said, ‚ÄúStay.‚Äù I had no desire to do all the different work required of the Speaker. I did not want to travel every weekend, trying to help colleagues who had short memories and might not appreciate my help anyway. I did not want to populate committees or referee fights or be responsible for herding the cats in the various factions within the larger Republican conference. The job would not have suited me, nor me it, and the title‚Äîany title at this point‚Äîhad lost its allure.With the mirror model, success‚Äîthe definition of success and the actualization of that success‚Äîcomes from within. Success is not an external monument of your achievements that you‚Äôre constantly building; rather, it is a practice of self-reflection and inner fulfillment enabling you to make decisions that echo your desired path.Now, when people ask me for advice about building a successful life, I tell them the story about the pyramid, the ladder, and the mirror. I tell them the three key ways the mirror is superior (though there are more):It doesn‚Äôt relegate you to a linear track. The mirror recognizes that as you change and grow, so do your dreams and plans. You can still be successful if you decide to change career paths twice over two decades.It enables you to find satisfaction in the phase of life you are currently in. This enables you to be more present and to celebrate and rest in accomplishments for a time.It focuses on the opinions of those who matter. Rather than collecting external titles and achievements, the mirror empowers you to fixate on your purpose and character‚Äîinternal pursuits‚Äîand look to the opinions of those who know you best. You can see others in the mirror‚Äîespecially those closest to you‚Äîand take their reflections into consideration, but your success isn‚Äôt dependent upon anyone else‚Äôs perception, performance, feedback, or praise.Life will not unfold in a straight line. You may start your career as a prosecutor and end up in television. You may major in history because it means less time in the classroom and then find yourself not only getting a law degree but also standing at the front of the classroom, teaching college and law school classes. So long as you look directly to the person in the mirror, you will be able to see more clearly the direction you should go.So, as I ask myself and others who come seeking counsel, I will ask you too: What do you see in the mirror? And do you like it?What to Look ForNow, some of you might be thinking that I only changed my perspective on success after I‚Äôd already climbed, built, and ascended the pyramid. I was a congressman, after all, so it must have been easy for me to say that external accolades don‚Äôt matter when I‚Äôd already achieved what others might deem a successful life. And you‚Äôre not wrong.If someone had presented me with a different model of success when I was younger, I don‚Äôt know that I would have followed it. I would like to think so, but I‚Äôm not sure. I am certain my mom or someone else tried to convince me earlier in life to be the best person I could be and let everything else fall into place after that. The concept of unconditional positive regard, untethered to acts or achievements, is hardly new. But it is difficult to change our thinking when we have been conditioned by others or external factors or culture to see and define success a certain way. It takes time to look at the faults and flaws of our current models and begin to deconstruct them. It takes time to learn the same old lesson that those things do not bring contentment. It takes time to trust ourselves as credible decision makers and definers of our own success. But once I was able to do that, I found myself wishing I had arrived at that place much earlier in life.To define success for yourself, look in the mirror, reflect on your past decisions, and ask yourself some questions: When have you felt most fulfilled and satisfied? What have you done in your life that filled you with a sense of purpose? When have you decided to be or do something solely for someone else, and what were the effects that had on you? Of everything you‚Äôve built and done in your life, what are you most proud of? Have you ever thought an achievement wasn‚Äôt worth the sacrifice? Whose opinions matter most to you, and why? Have you ever made a decision for the benefit of your image in others‚Äô eyes? How did that turn out? Was there any joy, and if so, how long did it last?All of these questions can help you build your own definition of success. And it‚Äôs important to remember that everything you‚Äôve built up to this moment is not wasted or left behind; it is informing what you see when you look in the mirror.What you decide to do in life may still look to others like the standard ladder; you may achieve success in the world‚Äôs eyes. But let that be an ancillary benefit, not the goal. My father either did not want me to attend the University of South Carolina undergrad or he forbade me to apply, depending on whose version of the facts you adopt. That is, in a real sense, how I wound up at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. My father did not want me to attend South Carolina even though he had, and he loved that school with all his heart. He was probably right. I would not have done well being around high school friends for those four years. So off to Texas I went. But I did make it to South Carolina‚Äôs law school, which was at the time the only law school in the state, so that was sort of a combination of necessity and opportunity. In May 2022, I made it back to the University of South Carolina for one final commencement exercise. The president and the board of trustees gave me an honorary doctorate for public service. To be clear, I did not and do not deserve it, but I am going to keep it anyway.I did not take my parents with me to the ceremony. I did not tell them about it ahead of time. I had to work my tail off to convince my wife to stay home. I don‚Äôt think I even mentioned it to my children. I did not care then, or now, whether anyone else knew about it‚Äîexcept my parents, after the fact. That was my goal‚Äîto make up for the mediocrity that prevented me from getting an undergraduate degree there earlier in life by returning later in life and getting an honorary doctorate. So there I was onstage, sitting a seat away from the president in between the chairman of the board and a past chairman of the board, both of whom were from the area my parents grew up in. That was why I went, for my parents. Because it meant something to me to do something for them. Although being called Dr. Trey sounds a lot like Dr. Dre, which is pretty cool too.Carve Your PathI used to feel an enormous amount of awe and pressure when I thought about Judge Russell. I pictured him on top of a pyramid when, in reality, he was sitting on a park bench reading a book during a football game. If we focus too much attention on artificial measures of success, we can lose sight of the most important thing, which is the people themselves. Now when I think of Judge Russell, I picture him reading peacefully in a park, enjoying the fullness of a football-less life. Sure, others named a federal courthouse after him, but he wasn‚Äôt sitting in that eponymous courthouse reading a book. He was sitting on a nameless park bench. That is what he valued. That is what I should have seen when I thought of him all along.Your reasons to start something new shouldn‚Äôt be dependent on anyone you can‚Äôt see clearly in your mirror. Your decisions do not always need to make sense to everyone else. They should, of course, be carefully considered and rooted in rational thought. But it is your life, and you only get one‚Äîand when you only have one of anything, you should treasure it and be a good steward of it.What you find significant and how you define success will likely not fall in line with what others deem significant or successful. That can be an apt measure of good decision making. Carve your own path, look in the mirror often, and don‚Äôt get distracted by the ladders and pyramids that others are trying to convince you to climb or construct.

INTRODUCTIONDecisions, DecisionsI only remember two things from my wedding ceremony. I remember trying to take off my white gloves so my bride could slip the ring on my finger, even though she had told me no fewer than one thousand times she would slide it on over the glove. (Oh my heavens was she unamused.) The pain of that relatively poor decision did not last very long, though. It was the other thing that happened during the wedding that weighed on my mind for decades, and still does from time to time.At the end of the ceremony, our wonderful and dearly loved pastor said, ‚ÄúNow I present you with Mr. and Mrs. Trey Gowdy; he will be in the governor‚Äôs mansion one day, and she will be our first lady.‚Äù I was twenty-four years old, one week removed from taking the bar exam, and had not even had my first legal job. But the expectation was set. A lofty one. In front of all of our family, friends, and acquaintances in the church we grew up in. It was an expectation that I could not imagine reaching. I wish he had said, ‚ÄúTerri will be the governor one day, and Trey can be her first gentleman.‚Äù That I could get behind.On that day and for a season thereafter, I let someone else set the expectations for what my life should look like. Perhaps you would have viewed the comment as harmless fun, which it was. Perhaps you would have viewed it as a goal to shoot for and nothing more. I should have done that. But I did not. I let other people define what was success for too long in my life. And I spent many years chasing the fulfillment of other people‚Äôs expectations. This is not the only example of me allowing others to chart my course, but it is one I remember thirty years removed.‚ÄîSome people die trying to meet the expectations of others. It is a lifelong sentence they submit themselves to. I was on that path. So, I want to ask you a question. The one I should have asked myself a long time ago.What is the standard by which you judge a life to be well lived?Some believe life is defined by their work: their career path, how high they‚Äôve risen in a company, or how happy they are in their job. Others would measure the quality of their relationships with friends and family. For some, the pursuit of education and the unceasing craving for knowledge drive a meaningful life. Or maybe the photo sections of our phones or our photo albums are really what tell our stories, revealing who and what we treasure.For most of my life, I evaluated my significance by the type and quality of the work I did. I firmly believed that my life could be judged a ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù by others‚Äîif I could secure this job or master this set of responsibilities. Through work, so I thought, I could prove my value to the world.On those frequent days when the jobs, titles, and responsibilities did not match the expectations I had set‚Äîor let others set‚Äîfor myself, my fallback marker was my relationships. I could rely on success by association, since many of my friends were more noteworthy than I was.Admittedly, this is not an ideal way to navigate through life, but it is, candidly, how I operated for more than half of my existence.I have come to realize that there is something larger that binds a life together. There is an inherent link among the jobs you take and the ones you don‚Äôt, the people you befriend and the relationships you end, the schools you choose and the hobbies you pursue. Every one of those pursuits is initiated, nurtured, extended, or perhaps severed because of the decisions you make.If you believe life is primarily defined by your career paths, think of the myriad decisions that shape that road. You have to decide which field to go into. You have to decide where to apply for work and which offer to accept. You have to decide when it‚Äôs the right time to leave a job and when it‚Äôs better to stay.If you believe the essence of life is the relationships and friendships made, you have to make the decision to befriend someone else or make the decision to accept their offer of friendship. And for those relationships that we don‚Äôt actively choose‚Äîmothers, fathers, siblings, or our natural children‚Äîwe decide how intimate we are with them through the course of our lives.For those who conclude that life is what we learn, formally or otherwise, and how we educate ourselves, some decision precedes that bit of education: where to attend school, what to study, how hard to apply ourselves, what to study or read even after our formal education has ended.Decisions‚Äîthese invisible underpinnings are the subject of this book. They are the building blocks of life. They touch every area of your life and they chart your course. I have found that if you excel at the art of decision making, you will undoubtedly craft a well-lived life.I am not a psychologist or a career counselor. I am not a statistician or a fortune-teller. My only credentials are my half century‚Äôs worth of decisions made and not made, and the life that flowed from those decisions. I have placed some of the riskiest bets you can ever wager and I have succumbed to fear. I have won and I have lost. I have even lost by winning and won by losing. I have regrets and I have beautiful memories, and sometimes I have a hard time telling those two apart.Through it all, I found that the most consequential decisions in life boil down to three simple questions, which I‚Äôd like to share with you: Do I start? Do I stay? Or do I leave?‚ÄîExperience is a wonderful teacher; it‚Äôs just that the course takes so long. Oh, to be able to go back and make the decisions of early life using all the knowledge and (possibly) wisdom I have now! Sometimes I look back at my winding path to divine whether I ever had a plan, or if my life choices were simply a series of reactions. Did I choose my course or did I allow others‚Äîor, more accurately, my perception of their expectations‚Äîto make my decisions for me?I started working at the age of fourteen, delivering newspapers on a motorized bicycle at 5:00 A.M. Now, half a lifetime later, I deliver news on TV on Sunday nights and on podcasts on Tuesdays and Thursdays. You could argue that my life has been something of a circle, professionally speaking, although going to work at 7:00 P.M. in an indoor television studio is much better than starting my day at 5:00 A.M. on a moped being chased by dogs.How do you go from delivering the news to delivering the news and consider it a productive life? There were many, many decisions made along the way. Every one of my jobs, from paperboy to television host, was preceded by a decision to start a new job, to stay where I was, or to leave and, in turn, start the cycle again.During the paper route days, I concluded that I was neither a morning person nor a huge fan of dogs, especially those that could outrun a motorized scooter, so I left the paper route mornings and opted for an afternoon job bagging groceries at a local grocery store after high school classes ended. (Eggs and bread go on top of the canned vegetables and not beneath them, if you are wondering.) Most of my time was spent taking the groceries to customers‚Äô cars. My employer did not allow tipping, but there were some kind souls who defied that ‚Äúban on tipping‚Äù and I began to take note of the difference between ‚Äúrules‚Äù and mere ‚Äúsuggestions.‚ÄùAs a bag boy I learned that there is a part of each of us that covets advancement, or at least perceived advancement. It‚Äôs been forty years, but I still remember my pride when my then boss, Charlie Jones, told me he was going to ‚Äúpromote‚Äù me to cashier. I went home that day feeling like a million bucks. (This was before computerized cash registers told you the right amount of change to return to the customer. If only Charlie Jones had asked for my transcripts and seen my math grades, I never would have been ‚Äúpromoted.‚Äù Public speaking and live television are nothing compared to a customer giving you $2.15 when the cash register says $1.65 and expecting the right change back. I still sweat thinking of those moments.)During college, from 1982 to 1986, I worked in a warehouse filling tobacco orders. I learned more about life in that warehouse than I ever did inside a classroom or the halls of Congress. The decision to work four summers in a hot, unairconditioned building driving a forklift and pulling a cart was not based on my enjoyment of the work itself. It was purely transactional: I needed money. My father would not just give me cash, instead saying something about the intrinsic value of work, and so off I went to the warehouse. But forty years removed from that job, it remains one of my favorites. How could sweating all day trying to figure out the difference between Virginia Slims and Virginia Slims Light 100s be one of my favorite jobs? Because I loved the guys I was working with. That, in and of itself, was satisfying enough‚ÄîI decided to stay and prioritize who I worked with over what I did.I looked forward to getting up and going to work at the warehouse more than any other job I have had since. And I still find myself reflecting on two of the lessons learned during those sweaty summers: (1) who you travel the highways of life with is often more important than what road you are on; and (2) for many people, working in a warehouse for minimum wage, with a thirty-minute lunch break and no health insurance, is not simply a ‚Äúsummer job,‚Äù it is their job and the one by which they are trying to meet all the familial and societal responsibilities demanded of them.In college, I decided to major in history for all the wrong reasons, and then I went to law school, since my initial poorly conceived decision did not leave me with many options. After law school, I clerked for two judges: One judge was an appellate judge and the other was a trial judge. It was while working for the federal trial judge that I was lured to our criminal justice system, which is where I spent the majority of my professional life. I was an assistant United States attorney for six years and then ran for what South Carolina calls ‚Äúcircuit solicitor‚Äù and the rest of the country calls ‚Äúdistrict attorney.‚ÄùThe decision to leave the work I loved as a prosecutor and start a career in Congress in 2011 is a big part of this book, as is my decision to leave Congress in 2019. Yes, the kid who started his career as a paperboy reading about Congress while rolling newspapers in a gas station bathroom ended up as the chairman of a congressional committee, occasionally even making it into the newspapers himself. As it turned out, being in the newspaper wasn‚Äôt nearly as fulfilling as that fourteen-year-old kid thought it would be. I learned the hard way, as many people do, that fame is not the proper barometer for success or significance. People spend decades striving for fame or notoriety and then, once they taste it, often go running back toward anonymity as fast as their feet will take them.As you can see, I‚Äôve made a lot of decisions in life. Some seem unconventional or strange in hindsight. Some were influenced by outside forces, and some (usually later in life) were made with the self-confidence that can only come from defining terms like ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù and ‚Äúsignificance‚Äù in your own way. People might argue that some of my decisions have been backward steps or maybe even missteps. But, in the end, others do not get to define those terms in my life‚Äîor yours.What is important is that we understand what we have done, and why we have done it, and that, moving forward, we apply a method and purpose to our decision making. I have written this book in hopes that those decisions I have made‚Äîgood, bad, or indifferent‚Äîcan help you as you write your own book of life.‚ÄîHow well do you know yourself? To build the best version of your life that you can, you have to know yourself and have enough confidence in that self-knowledge to let it guide your decision making.Now consider: Where do you want to wind up? What is the desired destination? Are you traveling with a certain degree of speed or commitment? Do you need to stay on this road but with a few adjustments, maybe slow down or accelerate? Or do you need to find an exit and backtrack or head in a totally new direction?Starting anything new is both exciting and nerve-racking. Doubt can creep in. There will be critics and naysayers. But in this book, I will offer you ways to evaluate when to start something new, whether a job or a relationship, so that you can move forward with confidence and awareness. In the summer of 2021, I started a new television show. Starting the show meant leaving the practice of law full-time. But it also meant deciding what I wanted the show to be like. Is one night a week enough or should I shoot for more? Do I copy what has been successful for others in the cable realm or chart my own path? For that matter, what does success even mean in television? Is it viewers or ratings? Is it the quality of my writing or the diversity of my guests? The beauty of a start is that the canvas is unspoiled. But the season of starting does not last long. Pretty soon what began as a decision to start became a decision to stay.Staying may lack the excitement of starting something new, but often it is the wisest course. We must evaluate the decision to stay using many of the same metrics and tools as we do when evaluating whether to start in the first place. My wife and I have lived in the same town for nearly half a century and have lived in the same house for nearly a quarter of a century. We often debated over questions such as: Do we move closer to the media centers of the country? Do we move closer to where the largest law firms are? Do we move closer to the beach (although I do not really like sand)? Do we embark on the excitement of building a house rather than adjusting what the original builders had in mind? Ultimately, we decided to stay put for a reason that wouldn‚Äôt matter to any other couple. It was the trees. When my wife‚Äôs dad died, a friend in landscaping planted a tree in his honor in our front yard. He did the same thing when her mom died. And he did the same thing to honor our three dogs, Judge, Jury, and Bailiff‚Äîall of whom have gone. We stayed in a house for reasons that had nothing to do with the house. We traded the excitement of something new for the memories we could not live without.Finally, this book will look at the difficult decision of leaving‚Äîof how to know when the time and the circumstances are right to leave something or someone. Even when we obtain the things we are striving for, sometimes they wind up being less satisfying than what we anticipated. Sometimes a decision can be right for a season of life, but the seasons change‚Äîand so do we. I hope to give you tools to leave with confidence and no regrets.We both find ourselves in this sentence, in this paragraph of this book, based on decisions we made. I am grateful you have made the decision to read this far. You and I will both need to be brutally honest and search deep within ourselves as we embark on this book, making decisions that will lead to the most fulsome and consequential life possible.So, shall we start?

Start at the End¬†As you‚Äôre thinking about starting something‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a new career or a new relationship, a new hobby or a new investment, starting fresh in a new city or starting to get more serious about your health‚Äîwhatever it is, I have found it‚Äôs best to start at the end. By creating a clear picture in your mind of your final destination, you will be better equipped to make decisions that ensure you reach that desired place.¬†Writing the Closing ArgumentFederal murder cases are rare.Because people tend to equate ‚Äúfederal crime‚Äù with ‚Äúmore serious crime,‚Äù they are often surprised to learn that the vast majority of murder cases are prosecuted not in federal but in state court, tried by state prosecutors. Only certain categories of murder warrant jurisdiction in the federal system‚Äîsuch as the murder of a federal judge, the murder of a federal law enforcement officer in the line of duty, or the murder of a federal witness.Prior to 1995, there had been only one federal murder prosecution in twenty-five years in the Upstate of South Carolina. Our state is divided into four regions. There is the Low Country near the beach (think Charleston). There is the region called the Midlands, which is where our capital of Columbia is. There is the Pee Dee region, which is largely agricultural. And there is the Upstate, which is a region connecting Atlanta, Georgia, to Charlotte, North Carolina, along Interstate 85. That‚Äôs where I live and have worked, and the region I represented in Congress.Just once in a quarter century had there been a federal murder case in my home region. But there would soon be two. The second one involved the murder of one of my own witnesses. I had just turned thirty years old and was still early into my career as a federal prosecutor. I was in a courtroom in Anderson, South Carolina, long before the advent of cellphones. We used pagers back then and my pager was vibrating a lot while I was in court that day. You don‚Äôt look down at your pager while you are in federal court, so I waited for a break and what I saw was a series of 911 pages from law enforcement officers. I hurried back to the judge‚Äôs chambers, which were adjacent to the courtroom, to use the nearest landline. When I reached one of the federal agents who had been paging me, his response was immediate and direct: ‚ÄúRicky Samuel has been killed.‚ÄùRicky Samuel was a young man from Spartanburg, South Carolina, who had been in some relatively minor legal trouble, but he was trying to change the course of his life. His current challenge was a pending federal drug case. The drug amounts were small but, as you will soon learn, even a small amount of drugs can have a significant impact on your life. Ricky was lucky in that he had a mother who loved him very much and was tougher on him than the court system was ever going to be. He also had a new girlfriend, and the thought of going to federal prison for any period of time was not likely to enhance this new relationship. Ricky had a decision to make. He could serve several years in federal prison for narcotics dealing or he could try to reduce his exposure to prison time.The federal drug system works like this: There are mandatory minimum prison sentences for even relatively small amounts of drugs. Five grams of cocaine base, commonly referred to as crack cocaine, equaled a mandatory minimum five years in prison. Fifty grams of cocaine base equaled a mandatory minimum ten years in federal prison. A gram is the size of a packet of Truvia or Sweet‚ÄôN Low. Ricky was charged with possessing an ounce of cocaine base, and even by pleading guilty and fully accepting responsibility, he would have received more than five years in federal prison. There is no parole in federal court so he would have served the overwhelming majority of whatever sentence was imposed.The only way to reduce one‚Äôs exposure to prison time, once arrested or indicted, is to cooperate with the government and have the government petition the court for a shorter prison sentence at the time of the sentencing hearing. Cooperating with the government means providing historical information on who one‚Äôs drug suppliers were or who were the partners or co-conspirators in the drug ring. Cooperating could also include more active work such as wearing a wire during an undercover drug transaction. In fact, the most significant cuts to prison sentences were often reserved for those who took the most risks in cooperating with the government. Wearing a wire and conducting undercover drug transactions were risky.I had hundreds of conversations with young men, and a few women, who, like Ricky Samuel, had that choice to make: do the time or cooperate and deal with the consequences of being labeled a ‚Äúrat.‚ÄùThe federal agents and I laid out Ricky‚Äôs options for him and his mother, and Ricky made the decision to cooperate with federal law enforcement in their investigation of a large South Carolina narcotics trafficking ring with ties to Florida.In reality, it was not much of a decision. Prison would be hard for Ricky. He was small in stature and had a slightly deformed arm, which would have made self-defense, often a necessity there, harder for him. He was not violent; he was just another young man who stopped his education too soon for the lure of easy and fast money. We shared with him that there were risks associated with cooperation, much like the doctor who goes over the risks before giving a flu vaccine or having relatively minor surgery. Yes, there is a chance something bad will happen, but the chances are so small that they tend not to even register. Until they do.We asked Ricky to help us in our investigation into Tommy Pabellon. Pabellon was a drug dealer who had sold cocaine base in larger amounts than someone like Ricky Samuel. Law enforcement‚Äôs plan had Ricky, acting in an undercover capacity, purchase cocaine base from Pabellon. It would be what the cops call a ‚Äúbuy bust.‚Äù An informant, typically wearing an audio or video wire or both, buys drugs from a suspected dealer with marked money. The deal is set up via phone or pager and those conversations are recorded as well. A short time after the transaction is completed, the dealer is arrested and, more often than not, the marked money is in his possession. These cases are common and not particularly complicated. The evidence consists of the recorded calls setting up the transaction, video and audio surveillance of the transaction itself, and then the proceeds of whatever is on the suspect when the arrest is made.Ricky did what he was told to do. The undercover drug transaction went down exactly as planned. Pabellon sold Ricky the drugs and was arrested a short time later and a short distance away with the marked buy money in his pocket.Once Pabellon was arrested, he had the same opportunity Ricky Samuel and others had‚Äîplead guilty, go to trial, or cooperate and lessen his exposure to prison. Pabellon opted for trial, and before the trial date was reached, the government had to produce what is called discovery, which is all of the evidence the government has as it relates to the defendant. The government tries to keep the identity of any informants or cooperating witnesses concealed for as long as possible, but inevitably those names are disclosed to the defense counsel, and then in turn the defendants themselves learn the identity of the informants. The disclosure of witness names is always a nervous time for prosecutors and agents and the witnesses themselves. Some defense attorneys share portions of the discovery with their clients but not all of it, and some defense attorneys just drop off the packets of information at the jail and allow the client to peruse the information for themselves. More than once discovery from one case has been found in the jail cell of another inmate. News about cooperating witnesses travels fast.The disclosure of witness names is one part of the criminal justice system that vexes those outside the system and frustrates those inside the system, even though we understand why it is necessary. Defendants have a constitutional right to ‚Äúconfront‚Äù witnesses as well as the right to know what evidence exists and will be presented at trial. The Confrontation Clause is in our U.S. Constitution. Even children have to testify in the trials of those who abuse them, sitting alone in a witness chair surrounded by adult strangers, with the defendant, the person who hurt the child, positioning himself squarely in the line of sight of the child. Our system affords significant safeguards to those accused of crimes, and part of that is knowing who the witnesses will be against that particular defendant.It is a separate and serious crime to threaten or intimidate witnesses. But sometimes those already charged with violating the law show disregard for other parts of the law.Tommy Pabellon found out during the discovery process that Ricky Samuel was the informant in his case, and he believed that if Ricky was not around to testify at trial, there would be no case against him. Pabellon devised a plan with other co-conspirators in his drug ring to have Ricky killed, and he hired an out-of-state hit man named Bob Harry Fowler. Fowler came to Spartanburg, South Carolina, and posed as a neighborhood street preacher in an effort to gain Ricky‚Äôs trust, doing door-to-door ‚Äúevangelizing‚Äù in Ricky‚Äôs neighborhood. The plan worked. Over the course of a few weeks, Bob Harry Fowler developed a relationship with Ricky and then, under the guise of taking him to be baptized, Fowler lured him to a remote pond in a neighboring county where he had Ricky get on his knees to pray the ‚ÄúSinner‚Äôs Prayer‚Äù and accept Jesus as his Lord and Savior. Fowler then shot Ricky twice in the back of the head.Ricky Samuel‚Äôs body was later found where he had been executed, beside that small pond in rural Greenville County, with two bullet wounds to the head. He was executed in retaliation for providing assistance and information to federal law enforcement officials. He was killed in a failed attempt to make the drug case against Tommy Pabellon disappear. No key witness, no case. At least that is what Pabellon thought.When I arrived at the murder scene, my first thought was of Ricky‚Äôs mother, of how we‚Äîfederal agents and prosecutors alike‚Äîhad assured her that the government would do everything in its power to protect her son if he decided to provide us with information. It was of little solace that we had explained what could happen. What was thought to be exceedingly rare‚Äîthe harming of a federal witness‚Äîhad in fact happened. Ricky had entrusted us with his life, and his mother had entrusted us with her son, and we had failed them both.Law enforcement gathered a general description of the new ‚Äúevangelist‚Äù in Ricky‚Äôs life from his family and friends, but Fowler had given a false name and left town immediately after he killed Ricky. Luckily, the forensics team found a Bible in Ricky‚Äôs home that Fowler had given to him as part of his street preacher ruse, and a forensics technician painstakingly went through that Bible, page by page, looking for fingerprints. When he found one, on a page in the book of Ezekiel, we ran the fingerprint through a national database to see if there was a match in anyone‚Äôs criminal history file. Because the ‚Äúevangelist‚Äù had prior convictions in other states, there was a hit in the database.How did a fingerprint from a contract killer from Alabama get on a Bible in Ricky Samuel‚Äôs home in Spartanburg, South Carolina? Why did this ‚Äústreet preacher‚Äù leave town so quickly after Ricky was killed? Why did the man who spent so much time around Ricky in the days and weeks before his death not even bother to attend his funeral? Those were just a few of the questions the prosecutors would ask the jury to reflect on at trial.The investigation into Ricky Samuel‚Äôs murder was long and difficult. After Bob Harry Fowler was identified, he was located and arrested for murder. But we had to connect him to Tommy Pabellon, and neither Fowler nor Pabellon was talking.While agents were actively working on putting the pieces of the murder case together, I decided to do something else: I decided to prove to Tommy Pabellon just how wrong he was about whether he could be prosecuted even without Ricky Samuel. So off to trial we went, and Pabellon was convicted of the drug charge even without Ricky Samuel present as a witness. But he also needed to be held to account for the murder of a federal witness.Law enforcement wound up arresting Tommy Pabellon‚Äôs wife on other charges and she eventually provided evidence and testimony against Tommy. The real break came when one of Tommy‚Äôs co-conspirators in their drug ring decided to cooperate, just as Ricky had, in an effort to reduce the significant time he was facing for conspiracy to murder a federal witness. We interviewed this co-defendant, corroborated his version of events, and planned on using him as a witness in the trial. He would have been a powerful witness, implicating both himself and Pabellon in the murder-for-hire scheme. And then this witness hanged himself in a prison cell.Law enforcement agents and prosecutors have to work with the evidence they have. They do not get to create the evidence they want or need. Fowler and Pabellon had the motive to kill Ricky Samuel, and Fowler had the means and access to do so. But still the trial would be about connecting Fowler to Pabellon. Pabellon did not pull the trigger, but he was the reason the trigger was pulled.The late, great federal prosecutor David C. Stephens and I prosecuted the case together. Stephens told me early on in our preparation that I would be doing the closing argument. All parts of a criminal trial are important, from pretrial motions and jury selection all the way through to the charging of the jury and the deliberations. But the closing argument is the last chance prosecutors get to make their argument to the jury. It is considered supremely important. I had made some closing arguments before but never in a case of this magnitude. And so I began a practice that I came to use in every case I prepared, prosecuted, and tried afterward: I started at the end.I wrote the closing argument first, and then worked my way backward to the beginning of the trial. There were witnesses to be called and examined and cross-examined. There were legal arguments to be made and exhibits to be introduced. I structured the presentation of evidence to get me to my desired ending.The closing argument is last. But it is also most important. I started with what was most important and made sure everything else worked in tandem with that.Starting at the end helped me in that first murder case, and I used that strategy in every trial thereafter. Eventually I embraced the tactic outside the courtroom, and it became the framework I‚Äôve employed in every major life decision I‚Äôve faced since then. Start at the end and then figure out how to get there.The Last SceneOne of the joys of middle age is that sometimes young people mistake longevity for wisdom. As a result, I frequently have young people visit or call, looking for advice on their nascent careers. I let them talk first, and what I typically hear is a confession of uncertainty, anxiety, and apprehension. They are not quite sure what they want to do‚Äîor even who they want to be‚Äîbut someone, somewhere told them they needed to have life figured out at the tender age of seventeen. And the pressure begins to mount, at least in their minds. Sometimes these young people are worried about making money; sometimes they are worried about finding a fulfilling career path. Most are worried‚Äîsome are even paralyzed‚Äîby the fear of making the wrong decisions.I remember one young man who came to see me when I was in Congress. He had life all mapped out, but it required him to gain admittance to one of our military academies. If that did not happen, according to him, nothing else would happen and his life was essentially over (at the age of seventeen) because it all hinged on going to West Point or the Naval Academy. Put aside for a second just how incredibly competitive those schools are and how little control the applicants have over whether or not they are selected. I could not get over his deep belief that all of his hopes and dreams hinged on being accepted at one of two highly competitive and selective schools.My first response had nothing to do with how to gain admittance to a highly selective college or university. I simply asked him where he wanted to wind up. It turned out he wanted to wind up exactly where I was, which was in Congress. ‚ÄúWho told you going to Annapolis or West Point was a necessary condition to running for Congress?‚Äù I asked him. ‚ÄúAnd who told you that even graduating from West Point or Annapolis would guarantee electoral success? And how will that make you a more effective member of Congress even if you are successful in both?‚Äù The real question, I tried to convince him, is not where he would spend the next four years but an even deeper, more significant question. Where did he want to be for his last four years? What did his last four months looks like? Last four minutes? Without being moribund, I wanted him to lean back in that chair in my office, close his eyes, and visualize a picture. The picture I wanted him to paint, with the most vivid details he could conjure, is the final scene.You can do the same.You‚Äôve passed from this world, hopefully after a long, happy, and healthy life, and family and close friends are waiting in a line to receive visitors. There is no more chance to leave a mark, make amends, rethink a decision, or change the story. Imagine the closing argument for your own life.When you think of that funeral scene, place yourself in that room eavesdropping on the conversations. If you see yourself as an angel, that‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt think I will qualify for that title, so I will go with just a spirit or a ghostlike figure lurking above the receiving line, but I want you to answer two questions:What have you accomplished?How are you remembered?Considering what people might say about them at their funeral usually snaps my young visitors to attention. (Or scares them away.) No one really enjoys thinking about the end. It‚Äôs hard and final, and it is understandable that we would rather dwell on happier thoughts. But death is one of the few things that is absolutely guaranteed in our lives, so these are important questions to ask, despite the uncomfortableness of it all. We have to will ourselves to do it‚Äîto think about the closing argument of life so we can structure the evidence and pick the witnesses who will testify about our lives. If life can be compared to a trial and if there is a final argument, a closing statement of sorts, what will be said and is there evidence to support it?The truth is, for many young adults figuring out what they want to do after they turn eighteen, their decisions revolve around vocation. What career field do they want to enter when they graduate? I try to encourage them to think of the other areas of their lives as well. What we seek to accomplish in life, in my judgment, should not be confined to a single area but should span relational, vocational, educational, and personal realms.We are human, of course, and a perfect balance is impossible, but thinking through how the various areas of life co-exist with one another helps give us better direction. If you make a lot of money but have no time for family, will you have accomplished what you want in life? If you are singularly focused on socializing in college and neglect your studies, are you setting yourself up to accomplish everything you want to achieve? All friends and no job is sort of like ‚Äúall hat and no cattle.‚ÄùAt any age, focusing on what we want to accomplish in a variety of areas will help give us that holistic picture as we move through life. When we decide to look at life through the lens of what we want to accomplish rather than simply what we want to do, life gains the significance we covet and our decision making will gain a sense of purpose.I wish I had a nickel for every young person who told me they wanted to make a difference in their community, their state, or their nation. Their motives were pure, near as I could tell. They really wanted to effectuate change. So, I listened and nodded my head as they explained to me why they needed to go to law school, and then go into politics or government, in order to bring about that change our society so desperately needed. And when it was my time to offer advice, it was always the same advice: If you want to change the world, you should teach.Teachers have changed my life more than any United States president or cabinet member. The person I live with, a first-grade teacher, will change the world more in one semester than I did in eight years in the House of Representatives.The prestige of what you do and the importance of what you accomplish are two entirely different things. The sooner we learn that truth, the more fulfilling life will be. If you are going to make the very best decisions in life, you are going to have to be honest with yourself. We all try to say the right things when others are listening. Say the honest thing when it is just you doing the talking and listening. I encourage these young people I have the good fortune to visit with to have a frank conversation with themselves about their real motivations as they relate to the decisions before them.Now, having a clear vision of the end is essential, but the actions you take to bring that image to life are what will determine whether you reach your desired destination. This is one case where it is not merely the thought that counts. You build your closing argument with the daily decisions you make. How you speak to people, how you make others feel, how you conduct your business, how well you take care of yourself and those you love, how much you help those in need, how generous you are with your time or money‚Äîall that is evidence that will be used and relied upon for your own closing argument in life.The things you think, do, and say each day are leading you to your final destination. Your decisions, wittingly or unwittingly made, will guide you somewhere, so I would encourage you not to keep that desired destination a secret‚Äîespecially from yourself. Put another way, the more you think about your closing argument now, the more likely you will be able to shape it between now and when folks put on their Sunday best to bid you farewell.And if we want to make the decisions that lead us to our desired closing arguments, we need to evaluate where we are now‚Äîas in today, the very moment you read this. If you need to change direction or the speed with which you are moving, now is the perfect time to analyze that. Are you happy in your career, school, major, key relationships? When you consider the big things like vocation, family, friendships, business relationships, and marriage, are you on track for your desired closing argument?What Do You Want to Accomplish?There is a tremendous difference between what we ‚Äúdo‚Äù and what we ‚Äúaccomplish.‚Äù Accomplishing something requires intent and purpose. Accomplishing something requires foresight of the ending. When we work toward accomplishing something, we have direction; if we are merely doing something, we are moving without direction, and we are more likely to get lost.For example, when I was considering college majors, I looked at what I needed to do to graduate, which was accrue 120 credit hours, rather than what I wanted to accomplish in life. I chose history because I went to college with six hours of Advanced Placement credit in history from high school, and that credit reduced the number of classes I needed for the major.I would have been much better off, in hindsight, majoring in philosophy so I could learn to think more critically or psychology so I could understand human nature. Thinking critically and understanding human nature are essential to helping people who have been the victims of crime, which is what ultimately wound up being what I wanted to accomplish in life.But still, I found a way to make it work because there are multiple routes to get to a destination. Some poor decisions cost you a lot, and some cost you next to nothing. I majored in history and wound up going to law school and ultimately found a career in the justice system that I loved. Even though I would have done college differently if given the chance, I eventually made sense of the path I chose and got to my destination despite the fact that the path was more circuitous than it needed to be.You are not ‚Äúfinished,‚Äù as that young man tried to convince me, if you don‚Äôt get into an elite military school. Your life is not ‚Äúover‚Äù because you didn‚Äôt get your dream job. You are not free to ‚Äúgive up‚Äù because you did not get an invitation to join this group or club. One misguided decision or unexpected setback might stop you from doing something specific, but it does not hinder you from accomplishing what you want to in life; it might just take you a little longer to get there. All routes may not be equal in length, difficulty, or scenery, but they can get you where you want to be if you are clear on your destination and dogged in your pursuit.Do not forget to consult your dreams. Usually when I ask young people what they hope to accomplish, I can see their eyes light up as they think about what some call dreams and others call goals or aspirations. Some of these young people are reluctant to verbalize those dreams for fear they will be perceived as too wild, fanciful, or unattainable. I am the first one to tell you that logic has a role in decision making. But it is essential and liberating to verbalize what we dream to be or¬†do.Logic and dreams can be roommates. They can be travel companions. That will be a recurring thread throughout this book (although some of the decisions I‚Äôve made in life may seem to indicate that logic was taking a nap while my dreams drove the car). Logic will and should take the lead. But when forming your image of the end and thinking through what you want to accomplish‚Äîwhat you want to be said of you to your family in the receiving line‚Äîit‚Äôs important to give your dreams the freedom to appear, exist, and be respected. Let them roam your mind as you explore where you want to go. Dreams may not dictate short-term decisions, but they help chart the longer course. There may even come that moment in your life when your dreams become real enough or lived enough to say, ‚ÄúWe are here. We finally made it.‚ÄùHow Do You Want to Be Remembered?For me, the picture of the end I envision is my wife and children at the mortuary not far from where we live. I delivered a newspaper early in the mornings to the mortuary office when I was a teenager, so it‚Äôs a familiar and friendly scene. (Well, as friendly as a mortuary can be to a fourteen-year-old on a moped in the dark.) Hopefully, it‚Äôs a sunny day so my wife isn‚Äôt cold, because she would be cold running wind sprints on the floor of an active volcano. The sun definitely needs to be bright and engaged in this photograph in my mind so she is warm and content. Plus, I won‚Äôt be there for her to tell me how cold she is.Ideally the service will be in the middle of the afternoon, so she can work most of the day at the elementary school where she teaches, take a short break for my service, and still get back home in time to watch Love Comes Softly or Love Comes Today or whatever is the most recent iteration of the exact same movie she has seen a trillion times on the Hallmark Channel. And, of course, the sooner the service ends, the sooner she can reach out to Matthew McConaughey on social media to let him know of her newfound availability.In my closing scene, I want it to be clear that I was a prosecutor, that I helped crime victims and their families fight for justice and accountability. I want people to think I was a loving husband to my wife and tried to be a good father to our children. This is the time for those who actually knew me‚Äînot the media, not my critics, not those who proliferate the comment sections of websites or social media posts‚Äîto say what they remember. I can think of nothing less credible than people who never met you or engaged with you describing your life to those who actually did know you. I hope people will say, ‚ÄúHe was funny and fair.‚Äù That would be a nice combination to leave with those I loved. It doesn‚Äôt matter to me whether anyone mentions Congress or not, although someone I met in Congress will be preaching the funeral. Likewise, it is not important to me that television or media be mentioned, although there is nothing in the world wrong with a career in the media, and I‚Äôm grateful for the job. It‚Äôs just that the courtroom is the job that meant the most to me, and therefore the one I hope others will remember.That final picture has the people who knew me best making my wife laugh with a memory or making her proud with a story. Funny and fair. That doesn‚Äôt sound overly ambitious, and, truth be told, that desired closing chapter or final picture may well have been different twenty years ago, before I understood the difference between who we are and what we do for a living. But it is settled now, and it likely won‚Äôt change at this point in my journey.What do you want people to say about you when you are gone? Where do you want to wind up, and what are you currently doing and deciding to make sure you make progress on that journey? Do you know yourself well enough to answer those questions today? Do you know yourself well enough to even ask those questions today?Your picture doesn‚Äôt have to include a funeral or service. It can be a retirement party or a hundredth birthday party or a seventy-fifth wedding anniversary. It‚Äôs not about the event. It‚Äôs about how you live on in the lives and memories of others, how you‚Äôve made an impact, and what you‚Äôve built with your life. You will be remembered by someone and for something. For how long and in what way is up to you. My hope is that our decisions can lead to a legacy that aligns with our dreams and intentions.It‚Äôs worth noting that your picture of the end may well evolve, as mine did, over time. Hopefully, as it changes and grows, there will be a general consistency or theme. As you begin living out your life, your end will hopefully become clearer and more defined. Yes, there will be curveballs and pitfalls. What we plan is not always what actually happens. We need to be capable of adapting, while still keeping our eyes on that end goal and picture.There is a Walmart near the home my wife and I have lived in for close to a quarter century. I frequented this Walmart quite a bit, especially when our kids were young. Our son loved LEGO sets and our daughter loved Barbie dolls and stuffed animals, so I spent lots of time in the toy section specifically. Every time I would haul my kids there to buy them more toys they didn‚Äôt need, we passed a greeter at the door. It was almost always the same greeter. Her name was Frankie, and she always had a story (usually with some length to it), always had some advice for me as a prosecutor, always had a piece of advice for law enforcement that I needed to pass on to the sheriff (preferably immediately), and sometimes had a bit of advice for Sam Walton (even though I repeatedly reminded her that I was not likely to bump into him along life‚Äôs highway).Frankie loved to talk and was always in a happy mood. I can almost guarantee the person you‚Äôre imagining right now, with the type of personality required to be a greeter at Walmart, is pretty accurate. Her liveliness and commentary consistently brought a smile to my face, and she slowly but surely taught me patience.Life moved on. My children grew older and their taste in toys became considerably more expensive. But there was always a reason I needed to go to Walmart, and Frankie was always there at the door. Until she wasn‚Äôt. She had been gone for about a week when, for a reason I don‚Äôt fully understand, I decided to look in a section of the local newspaper I rarely visit: the obituaries. There she was.My wife always has a sense of what the right thing to do is. She suggested the right thing to do was to go pay my respects at Frankie‚Äôs visitation. I did not even know Frankie‚Äôs last name until I read the obituary, and I certainly did not know anything about her family. But my wife said I should go, so I went. I drove to a small funeral home in a rural part of our county. There weren‚Äôt many cars in the lot, and there was no line, making me think I was at the wrong funeral home or had the wrong time. But I followed the signs down the hall and found the room with Frankie‚Äôs casket. There were only a handful of people standing around. No formalities. No service‚Äîor not that night at least. I paid my respects and left shortly thereafter. It struck me as sad that so few other people were there. I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting, but it was different from what I saw.I wish I had spoken to the people there that night. I wish I had talked about the way Frankie approached strangers with friendliness and humor, the way she built relationships in one-minute intervals as people were passing through what she called ‚Äúher door.‚Äù Her legacy influenced the way I view strangers and even the way I view small talk. It‚Äôs actually not always so ‚Äúsmall,‚Äù in hindsight, at least to those with whom you are talking. There are pearls of wisdom in the brief encounters we have in life, and there is never a wrong time to make others feel valued.The truth is, legacy lasts far beyond the words spoken or left unspoken at your funeral. Your closing argument isn‚Äôt just found in what people say‚Äîor how many speak up‚Äîabout you, but in how you made them feel. Frankie‚Äôs closing argument was built from the decision she made every day to show up with a smile, her decision to engage with people some might call strangers, and to remind them of the importance of slowing down and prioritizing human connection. She decided to try to make the world a better place the best way she knew how. She made people feel welcome, and that is one of the best feelings you can give someone.I still think of Frankie frequently when I pass a Walmart. I actually think of Frankie far more often than I do the man who started Walmart. Her memory reminds me to slow down, that it‚Äôs okay to smile from time to time and not always be in such a hurry. Life is not a hundred-meter dash. It‚Äôs okay to talk with the people we are walking this marathon with. I wonder how many other Walmart shoppers were impacted by Frankie the way I was. I bet if they knew she‚Äôd passed away, there would have been a larger crowd at the funeral home that night. But the size of the audience often does not equate to the quality of the performance.If you judge success by public adoration, media attention, fame, wealth, awards, or titles, then I guess Frankie would not be considered wildly successful. If, on the other hand, you measure life‚Äîthe accumulation of the decisions you make‚Äîaccording to the longevity and significance of what is remembered even by a few, then I would say Frankie is still alive and well.You cannot script with precision what‚Äôs going to happen in the end, but by thinking through what you want to be said of you, how you want to be remembered‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs said at your visitation or memorialized in a book years later‚Äîit will give you direction on whether to start, stay, or leave when you find yourself at a crossroads.The Note You End OnWhen writing the closing argument for that first murder trial, there were a number of different angles to choose from. We had hundreds of pieces of evidence. What did I want the jury to be left with? Would it be the fingerprint found in Ricky Samuel‚Äôs Bible? Would it be the symbolism of taking a man to accept Jesus and then putting two bullets in the back of his head, ensuring that he did, in fact, meet Jesus? Would it be the testimony of co-conspirators? Would it be the motive of wanting to eliminate a witness? How could we close this case in the most effective and persuasive way possible?I decided to end with a simple, single photograph of the crime scene.In this photograph, you had the benefit of simplicity, of imploring the jury to simply exercise its collective common sense. Picture the scene in your mind as it was depicted in this still photograph: A young man‚Äôs lifeless body lay mere feet away from a small pond with grass and trees on the periphery. The only evidence contained in that photograph was the body itself. The perpetrator was not in the photograph. The murder weapon was not in the photograph. But that photograph was powerful nonetheless. The loneliness was powerful. The inhumanity was powerful. The weakness of the federal government to protect its own witnesses was powerful.In this photograph there was a reflection off the water of that small pond. The surrounding grass and trees mirrored in that body of water. What if those actually were our witnesses? What if the grass and trees could testify? What would this photograph say if the photograph could speak to us?Indeed, it is speaking to us. It is telling us what happened if we will only listen. That photograph had the water needed for a manufactured baptism. It had the isolation needed for a crime. It had the anonymity someone not from the area would want and need. It had the absence of traditional witnesses. Photographs do not have failed recollections. They are the perfect distillation of a specific time and place. And in that regard, they are the best witnesses you could ever have.Who had the motive to kill Ricky Samuel? Who were the new faces in his life who could lure him to a small body of water miles removed from where he called home? Who did he trust enough to get into a car with and search for a proper baptismal pond? If you could rewind this photograph from when it was taken to when the image was actually created, who do you think would be there? Whose reflection would we see in the pond? And don‚Äôt you think the reflection from the pond belongs to the same person whose fingerprint was found in the book of Ezekiel?Since this was the first murder trial I had ever been part of, I experienced the raw and acute feelings of loss, finality, and loneliness attendant to homicide cases. Seasoned homicide investigators and litigators may eventually grow accustomed to these feelings, but they were brand-new for me, and more importantly, these feelings would be brand-new for the members of the jury. I knew that in order to win the case, I needed my closing argument to appeal to both logic and these raw emotions that would deeply resonate with the jury, the observers, the final decision makers. Throughout the trial, knowing I wanted to end with the photograph, I emphasized the inhumanity of the murder and the events preceding it, and I appealed to the humanity of the jury, empathizing with the emotions that the facts of the case conjured.Something terrible, tragic, and lethal happened by that pond, even if there was no one there to witness it. The absence of human perception does not obviate reality. A life was taken even if there was no one left among the living to tell us who did it.There are always questions at the end of a trial, no matter the amount of evidence produced. People are wired to ask questions. We are, in some ways, wired to see doubt both in ourselves and in others. The photograph allowed the jury to ask all the right questions as they were deliberating. And employing reason, probability, and common sense as they went through the evidence and the testimony would provide the answers to those questions.Bob Harry Fowler and Tommy Pabellon were convicted by a federal jury in Greenville, South Carolina, and given four life sentences for the murder for hire of federal witness Ricky Samuel. I have lost count of the number of homicide cases I prosecuted after Ricky Samuel‚Äôs. But I never lost sight of the tactic that worked, at least for me. Start at the end. What is the last point you want to make, and how can everything else you do and say empower you to make that argument?

### ‚ú® It just means you have to know when it‚Äôs time to leave.‚ÄîThe challenge of being a domestic or interpersonal violence prosecutor is invariably that someone hurts or kills a person they claimed to ‚Äúlove.‚ÄùThe challenge of being a child abuse or child sex abuse prosecutor is at least twofold: (1) There is the loss of innocence you experience when the most vulnerable are hurt, terrorized, and abused; and (2) your mind begins to perceive threats to your own children where rationally they do not exist.The challenge of being a homicide prosecutor is you are always dealing with death‚Äîand it is often the kind of death we fear the most, the kind where the front door of our lives is kicked in, without a moment‚Äôs notice, no time to say goodbye, no time to make amends, no time to utter a petition.


INTRODUCTIONDecisions, DecisionsI only remember two things from my wedding ceremony. I remember trying to take off my white gloves so my bride could slip the ring on my finger, even though she had told me no fewer than one thousand times she would slide it on over the glove. (Oh my heavens was she unamused.) The pain of that relatively poor decision did not last very long, though. It was the other thing that happened during the wedding that weighed on my mind for decades, and still does from time to time.At the end of the ceremony, our wonderful and dearly loved pastor said, ‚ÄúNow I present you with Mr. and Mrs. Trey Gowdy; he will be in the governor‚Äôs mansion one day, and she will be our first lady.‚Äù I was twenty-four years old, one week removed from taking the bar exam, and had not even had my first legal job. But the expectation was set. A lofty one. In front of all of our family, friends, and acquaintances in the church we grew up in. It was an expectation that I could not imagine reaching. I wish he had said, ‚ÄúTerri will be the governor one day, and Trey can be her first gentleman.‚Äù That I could get behind.On that day and for a season thereafter, I let someone else set the expectations for what my life should look like. Perhaps you would have viewed the comment as harmless fun, which it was. Perhaps you would have viewed it as a goal to shoot for and nothing more. I should have done that. But I did not. I let other people define what was success for too long in my life. And I spent many years chasing the fulfillment of other people‚Äôs expectations. This is not the only example of me allowing others to chart my course, but it is one I remember thirty years removed.‚ÄîSome people die trying to meet the expectations of others. It is a lifelong sentence they submit themselves to. I was on that path. So, I want to ask you a question. The one I should have asked myself a long time ago.What is the standard by which you judge a life to be well lived?Some believe life is defined by their work: their career path, how high they‚Äôve risen in a company, or how happy they are in their job. Others would measure the quality of their relationships with friends and family. For some, the pursuit of education and the unceasing craving for knowledge drive a meaningful life. Or maybe the photo sections of our phones or our photo albums are really what tell our stories, revealing who and what we treasure.For most of my life, I evaluated my significance by the type and quality of the work I did. I firmly believed that my life could be judged a ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù by others‚Äîif I could secure this job or master this set of responsibilities. Through work, so I thought, I could prove my value to the world.On those frequent days when the jobs, titles, and responsibilities did not match the expectations I had set‚Äîor let others set‚Äîfor myself, my fallback marker was my relationships. I could rely on success by association, since many of my friends were more noteworthy than I was.Admittedly, this is not an ideal way to navigate through life, but it is, candidly, how I operated for more than half of my existence.I have come to realize that there is something larger that binds a life together. There is an inherent link among the jobs you take and the ones you don‚Äôt, the people you befriend and the relationships you end, the schools you choose and the hobbies you pursue. Every one of those pursuits is initiated, nurtured, extended, or perhaps severed because of the decisions you make.If you believe life is primarily defined by your career paths, think of the myriad decisions that shape that road. You have to decide which field to go into. You have to decide where to apply for work and which offer to accept. You have to decide when it‚Äôs the right time to leave a job and when it‚Äôs better to stay.If you believe the essence of life is the relationships and friendships made, you have to make the decision to befriend someone else or make the decision to accept their offer of friendship. And for those relationships that we don‚Äôt actively choose‚Äîmothers, fathers, siblings, or our natural children‚Äîwe decide how intimate we are with them through the course of our lives.For those who conclude that life is what we learn, formally or otherwise, and how we educate ourselves, some decision precedes that bit of education: where to attend school, what to study, how hard to apply ourselves, what to study or read even after our formal education has ended.Decisions‚Äîthese invisible underpinnings are the subject of this book. They are the building blocks of life. They touch every area of your life and they chart your course. I have found that if you excel at the art of decision making, you will undoubtedly craft a well-lived life.I am not a psychologist or a career counselor. I am not a statistician or a fortune-teller. My only credentials are my half century‚Äôs worth of decisions made and not made, and the life that flowed from those decisions. I have placed some of the riskiest bets you can ever wager and I have succumbed to fear. I have won and I have lost. I have even lost by winning and won by losing. I have regrets and I have beautiful memories, and sometimes I have a hard time telling those two apart.Through it all, I found that the most consequential decisions in life boil down to three simple questions, which I‚Äôd like to share with you: Do I start? Do I stay? Or do I leave?‚ÄîExperience is a wonderful teacher; it‚Äôs just that the course takes so long. Oh, to be able to go back and make the decisions of early life using all the knowledge and (possibly) wisdom I have now! Sometimes I look back at my winding path to divine whether I ever had a plan, or if my life choices were simply a series of reactions. Did I choose my course or did I allow others‚Äîor, more accurately, my perception of their expectations‚Äîto make my decisions for me?I started working at the age of fourteen, delivering newspapers on a motorized bicycle at 5:00 A.M. Now, half a lifetime later, I deliver news on TV on Sunday nights and on podcasts on Tuesdays and Thursdays. You could argue that my life has been something of a circle, professionally speaking, although going to work at 7:00 P.M. in an indoor television studio is much better than starting my day at 5:00 A.M. on a moped being chased by dogs.How do you go from delivering the news to delivering the news and consider it a productive life? There were many, many decisions made along the way. Every one of my jobs, from paperboy to television host, was preceded by a decision to start a new job, to stay where I was, or to leave and, in turn, start the cycle again.During the paper route days, I concluded that I was neither a morning person nor a huge fan of dogs, especially those that could outrun a motorized scooter, so I left the paper route mornings and opted for an afternoon job bagging groceries at a local grocery store after high school classes ended. (Eggs and bread go on top of the canned vegetables and not beneath them, if you are wondering.) Most of my time was spent taking the groceries to customers‚Äô cars. My employer did not allow tipping, but there were some kind souls who defied that ‚Äúban on tipping‚Äù and I began to take note of the difference between ‚Äúrules‚Äù and mere ‚Äúsuggestions.‚ÄùAs a bag boy I learned that there is a part of each of us that covets advancement, or at least perceived advancement. It‚Äôs been forty years, but I still remember my pride when my then boss, Charlie Jones, told me he was going to ‚Äúpromote‚Äù me to cashier. I went home that day feeling like a million bucks. (This was before computerized cash registers told you the right amount of change to return to the customer. If only Charlie Jones had asked for my transcripts and seen my math grades, I never would have been ‚Äúpromoted.‚Äù Public speaking and live television are nothing compared to a customer giving you $2.15 when the cash register says $1.65 and expecting the right change back. I still sweat thinking of those moments.)During college, from 1982 to 1986, I worked in a warehouse filling tobacco orders. I learned more about life in that warehouse than I ever did inside a classroom or the halls of Congress. The decision to work four summers in a hot, unairconditioned building driving a forklift and pulling a cart was not based on my enjoyment of the work itself. It was purely transactional: I needed money. My father would not just give me cash, instead saying something about the intrinsic value of work, and so off I went to the warehouse. But forty years removed from that job, it remains one of my favorites. How could sweating all day trying to figure out the difference between Virginia Slims and Virginia Slims Light 100s be one of my favorite jobs? Because I loved the guys I was working with. That, in and of itself, was satisfying enough‚ÄîI decided to stay and prioritize who I worked with over what I did.I looked forward to getting up and going to work at the warehouse more than any other job I have had since. And I still find myself reflecting on two of the lessons learned during those sweaty summers: (1) who you travel the highways of life with is often more important than what road you are on; and (2) for many people, working in a warehouse for minimum wage, with a thirty-minute lunch break and no health insurance, is not simply a ‚Äúsummer job,‚Äù it is their job and the one by which they are trying to meet all the familial and societal responsibilities demanded of them.In college, I decided to major in history for all the wrong reasons, and then I went to law school, since my initial poorly conceived decision did not leave me with many options. After law school, I clerked for two judges: One judge was an appellate judge and the other was a trial judge. It was while working for the federal trial judge that I was lured to our criminal justice system, which is where I spent the majority of my professional life. I was an assistant United States attorney for six years and then ran for what South Carolina calls ‚Äúcircuit solicitor‚Äù and the rest of the country calls ‚Äúdistrict attorney.‚ÄùThe decision to leave the work I loved as a prosecutor and start a career in Congress in 2011 is a big part of this book, as is my decision to leave Congress in 2019. Yes, the kid who started his career as a paperboy reading about Congress while rolling newspapers in a gas station bathroom ended up as the chairman of a congressional committee, occasionally even making it into the newspapers himself. As it turned out, being in the newspaper wasn‚Äôt nearly as fulfilling as that fourteen-year-old kid thought it would be. I learned the hard way, as many people do, that fame is not the proper barometer for success or significance. People spend decades striving for fame or notoriety and then, once they taste it, often go running back toward anonymity as fast as their feet will take them.As you can see, I‚Äôve made a lot of decisions in life. Some seem unconventional or strange in hindsight. Some were influenced by outside forces, and some (usually later in life) were made with the self-confidence that can only come from defining terms like ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù and ‚Äúsignificance‚Äù in your own way. People might argue that some of my decisions have been backward steps or maybe even missteps. But, in the end, others do not get to define those terms in my life‚Äîor yours.What is important is that we understand what we have done, and why we have done it, and that, moving forward, we apply a method and purpose to our decision making. I have written this book in hopes that those decisions I have made‚Äîgood, bad, or indifferent‚Äîcan help you as you write your own book of life.‚ÄîHow well do you know yourself? To build the best version of your life that you can, you have to know yourself and have enough confidence in that self-knowledge to let it guide your decision making.Now consider: Where do you want to wind up? What is the desired destination? Are you traveling with a certain degree of speed or commitment? Do you need to stay on this road but with a few adjustments, maybe slow down or accelerate? Or do you need to find an exit and backtrack or head in a totally new direction?Starting anything new is both exciting and nerve-racking. Doubt can creep in. There will be critics and naysayers. But in this book, I will offer you ways to evaluate when to start something new, whether a job or a relationship, so that you can move forward with confidence and awareness. In the summer of 2021, I started a new television show. Starting the show meant leaving the practice of law full-time. But it also meant deciding what I wanted the show to be like. Is one night a week enough or should I shoot for more? Do I copy what has been successful for others in the cable realm or chart my own path? For that matter, what does success even mean in television? Is it viewers or ratings? Is it the quality of my writing or the diversity of my guests? The beauty of a start is that the canvas is unspoiled. But the season of starting does not last long. Pretty soon what began as a decision to start became a decision to stay.Staying may lack the excitement of starting something new, but often it is the wisest course. We must evaluate the decision to stay using many of the same metrics and tools as we do when evaluating whether to start in the first place. My wife and I have lived in the same town for nearly half a century and have lived in the same house for nearly a quarter of a century. We often debated over questions such as: Do we move closer to the media centers of the country? Do we move closer to where the largest law firms are? Do we move closer to the beach (although I do not really like sand)? Do we embark on the excitement of building a house rather than adjusting what the original builders had in mind? Ultimately, we decided to stay put for a reason that wouldn‚Äôt matter to any other couple. It was the trees. When my wife‚Äôs dad died, a friend in landscaping planted a tree in his honor in our front yard. He did the same thing when her mom died. And he did the same thing to honor our three dogs, Judge, Jury, and Bailiff‚Äîall of whom have gone. We stayed in a house for reasons that had nothing to do with the house. We traded the excitement of something new for the memories we could not live without.Finally, this book will look at the difficult decision of leaving‚Äîof how to know when the time and the circumstances are right to leave something or someone. Even when we obtain the things we are striving for, sometimes they wind up being less satisfying than what we anticipated. Sometimes a decision can be right for a season of life, but the seasons change‚Äîand so do we. I hope to give you tools to leave with confidence and no regrets.We both find ourselves in this sentence, in this paragraph of this book, based on decisions we made. I am grateful you have made the decision to read this far. You and I will both need to be brutally honest and search deep within ourselves as we embark on this book, making decisions that will lead to the most fulsome and consequential life possible.So, shall we start?

Start at the End¬†As you‚Äôre thinking about starting something‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a new career or a new relationship, a new hobby or a new investment, starting fresh in a new city or starting to get more serious about your health‚Äîwhatever it is, I have found it‚Äôs best to start at the end. By creating a clear picture in your mind of your final destination, you will be better equipped to make decisions that ensure you reach that desired place.¬†Writing the Closing ArgumentFederal murder cases are rare.Because people tend to equate ‚Äúfederal crime‚Äù with ‚Äúmore serious crime,‚Äù they are often surprised to learn that the vast majority of murder cases are prosecuted not in federal but in state court, tried by state prosecutors. Only certain categories of murder warrant jurisdiction in the federal system‚Äîsuch as the murder of a federal judge, the murder of a federal law enforcement officer in the line of duty, or the murder of a federal witness.Prior to 1995, there had been only one federal murder prosecution in twenty-five years in the Upstate of South Carolina. Our state is divided into four regions. There is the Low Country near the beach (think Charleston). There is the region called the Midlands, which is where our capital of Columbia is. There is the Pee Dee region, which is largely agricultural. And there is the Upstate, which is a region connecting Atlanta, Georgia, to Charlotte, North Carolina, along Interstate 85. That‚Äôs where I live and have worked, and the region I represented in Congress.Just once in a quarter century had there been a federal murder case in my home region. But there would soon be two. The second one involved the murder of one of my own witnesses. I had just turned thirty years old and was still early into my career as a federal prosecutor. I was in a courtroom in Anderson, South Carolina, long before the advent of cellphones. We used pagers back then and my pager was vibrating a lot while I was in court that day. You don‚Äôt look down at your pager while you are in federal court, so I waited for a break and what I saw was a series of 911 pages from law enforcement officers. I hurried back to the judge‚Äôs chambers, which were adjacent to the courtroom, to use the nearest landline. When I reached one of the federal agents who had been paging me, his response was immediate and direct: ‚ÄúRicky Samuel has been killed.‚ÄùRicky Samuel was a young man from Spartanburg, South Carolina, who had been in some relatively minor legal trouble, but he was trying to change the course of his life. His current challenge was a pending federal drug case. The drug amounts were small but, as you will soon learn, even a small amount of drugs can have a significant impact on your life. Ricky was lucky in that he had a mother who loved him very much and was tougher on him than the court system was ever going to be. He also had a new girlfriend, and the thought of going to federal prison for any period of time was not likely to enhance this new relationship. Ricky had a decision to make. He could serve several years in federal prison for narcotics dealing or he could try to reduce his exposure to prison time.The federal drug system works like this: There are mandatory minimum prison sentences for even relatively small amounts of drugs. Five grams of cocaine base, commonly referred to as crack cocaine, equaled a mandatory minimum five years in prison. Fifty grams of cocaine base equaled a mandatory minimum ten years in federal prison. A gram is the size of a packet of Truvia or Sweet‚ÄôN Low. Ricky was charged with possessing an ounce of cocaine base, and even by pleading guilty and fully accepting responsibility, he would have received more than five years in federal prison. There is no parole in federal court so he would have served the overwhelming majority of whatever sentence was imposed.The only way to reduce one‚Äôs exposure to prison time, once arrested or indicted, is to cooperate with the government and have the government petition the court for a shorter prison sentence at the time of the sentencing hearing. Cooperating with the government means providing historical information on who one‚Äôs drug suppliers were or who were the partners or co-conspirators in the drug ring. Cooperating could also include more active work such as wearing a wire during an undercover drug transaction. In fact, the most significant cuts to prison sentences were often reserved for those who took the most risks in cooperating with the government. Wearing a wire and conducting undercover drug transactions were risky.I had hundreds of conversations with young men, and a few women, who, like Ricky Samuel, had that choice to make: do the time or cooperate and deal with the consequences of being labeled a ‚Äúrat.‚ÄùThe federal agents and I laid out Ricky‚Äôs options for him and his mother, and Ricky made the decision to cooperate with federal law enforcement in their investigation of a large South Carolina narcotics trafficking ring with ties to Florida.In reality, it was not much of a decision. Prison would be hard for Ricky. He was small in stature and had a slightly deformed arm, which would have made self-defense, often a necessity there, harder for him. He was not violent; he was just another young man who stopped his education too soon for the lure of easy and fast money. We shared with him that there were risks associated with cooperation, much like the doctor who goes over the risks before giving a flu vaccine or having relatively minor surgery. Yes, there is a chance something bad will happen, but the chances are so small that they tend not to even register. Until they do.We asked Ricky to help us in our investigation into Tommy Pabellon. Pabellon was a drug dealer who had sold cocaine base in larger amounts than someone like Ricky Samuel. Law enforcement‚Äôs plan had Ricky, acting in an undercover capacity, purchase cocaine base from Pabellon. It would be what the cops call a ‚Äúbuy bust.‚Äù An informant, typically wearing an audio or video wire or both, buys drugs from a suspected dealer with marked money. The deal is set up via phone or pager and those conversations are recorded as well. A short time after the transaction is completed, the dealer is arrested and, more often than not, the marked money is in his possession. These cases are common and not particularly complicated. The evidence consists of the recorded calls setting up the transaction, video and audio surveillance of the transaction itself, and then the proceeds of whatever is on the suspect when the arrest is made.Ricky did what he was told to do. The undercover drug transaction went down exactly as planned. Pabellon sold Ricky the drugs and was arrested a short time later and a short distance away with the marked buy money in his pocket.Once Pabellon was arrested, he had the same opportunity Ricky Samuel and others had‚Äîplead guilty, go to trial, or cooperate and lessen his exposure to prison. Pabellon opted for trial, and before the trial date was reached, the government had to produce what is called discovery, which is all of the evidence the government has as it relates to the defendant. The government tries to keep the identity of any informants or cooperating witnesses concealed for as long as possible, but inevitably those names are disclosed to the defense counsel, and then in turn the defendants themselves learn the identity of the informants. The disclosure of witness names is always a nervous time for prosecutors and agents and the witnesses themselves. Some defense attorneys share portions of the discovery with their clients but not all of it, and some defense attorneys just drop off the packets of information at the jail and allow the client to peruse the information for themselves. More than once discovery from one case has been found in the jail cell of another inmate. News about cooperating witnesses travels fast.The disclosure of witness names is one part of the criminal justice system that vexes those outside the system and frustrates those inside the system, even though we understand why it is necessary. Defendants have a constitutional right to ‚Äúconfront‚Äù witnesses as well as the right to know what evidence exists and will be presented at trial. The Confrontation Clause is in our U.S. Constitution. Even children have to testify in the trials of those who abuse them, sitting alone in a witness chair surrounded by adult strangers, with the defendant, the person who hurt the child, positioning himself squarely in the line of sight of the child. Our system affords significant safeguards to those accused of crimes, and part of that is knowing who the witnesses will be against that particular defendant.It is a separate and serious crime to threaten or intimidate witnesses. But sometimes those already charged with violating the law show disregard for other parts of the law.Tommy Pabellon found out during the discovery process that Ricky Samuel was the informant in his case, and he believed that if Ricky was not around to testify at trial, there would be no case against him. Pabellon devised a plan with other co-conspirators in his drug ring to have Ricky killed, and he hired an out-of-state hit man named Bob Harry Fowler. Fowler came to Spartanburg, South Carolina, and posed as a neighborhood street preacher in an effort to gain Ricky‚Äôs trust, doing door-to-door ‚Äúevangelizing‚Äù in Ricky‚Äôs neighborhood. The plan worked. Over the course of a few weeks, Bob Harry Fowler developed a relationship with Ricky and then, under the guise of taking him to be baptized, Fowler lured him to a remote pond in a neighboring county where he had Ricky get on his knees to pray the ‚ÄúSinner‚Äôs Prayer‚Äù and accept Jesus as his Lord and Savior. Fowler then shot Ricky twice in the back of the head.Ricky Samuel‚Äôs body was later found where he had been executed, beside that small pond in rural Greenville County, with two bullet wounds to the head. He was executed in retaliation for providing assistance and information to federal law enforcement officials. He was killed in a failed attempt to make the drug case against Tommy Pabellon disappear. No key witness, no case. At least that is what Pabellon thought.When I arrived at the murder scene, my first thought was of Ricky‚Äôs mother, of how we‚Äîfederal agents and prosecutors alike‚Äîhad assured her that the government would do everything in its power to protect her son if he decided to provide us with information. It was of little solace that we had explained what could happen. What was thought to be exceedingly rare‚Äîthe harming of a federal witness‚Äîhad in fact happened. Ricky had entrusted us with his life, and his mother had entrusted us with her son, and we had failed them both.Law enforcement gathered a general description of the new ‚Äúevangelist‚Äù in Ricky‚Äôs life from his family and friends, but Fowler had given a false name and left town immediately after he killed Ricky. Luckily, the forensics team found a Bible in Ricky‚Äôs home that Fowler had given to him as part of his street preacher ruse, and a forensics technician painstakingly went through that Bible, page by page, looking for fingerprints. When he found one, on a page in the book of Ezekiel, we ran the fingerprint through a national database to see if there was a match in anyone‚Äôs criminal history file. Because the ‚Äúevangelist‚Äù had prior convictions in other states, there was a hit in the database.How did a fingerprint from a contract killer from Alabama get on a Bible in Ricky Samuel‚Äôs home in Spartanburg, South Carolina? Why did this ‚Äústreet preacher‚Äù leave town so quickly after Ricky was killed? Why did the man who spent so much time around Ricky in the days and weeks before his death not even bother to attend his funeral? Those were just a few of the questions the prosecutors would ask the jury to reflect on at trial.The investigation into Ricky Samuel‚Äôs murder was long and difficult. After Bob Harry Fowler was identified, he was located and arrested for murder. But we had to connect him to Tommy Pabellon, and neither Fowler nor Pabellon was talking.While agents were actively working on putting the pieces of the murder case together, I decided to do something else: I decided to prove to Tommy Pabellon just how wrong he was about whether he could be prosecuted even without Ricky Samuel. So off to trial we went, and Pabellon was convicted of the drug charge even without Ricky Samuel present as a witness. But he also needed to be held to account for the murder of a federal witness.Law enforcement wound up arresting Tommy Pabellon‚Äôs wife on other charges and she eventually provided evidence and testimony against Tommy. The real break came when one of Tommy‚Äôs co-conspirators in their drug ring decided to cooperate, just as Ricky had, in an effort to reduce the significant time he was facing for conspiracy to murder a federal witness. We interviewed this co-defendant, corroborated his version of events, and planned on using him as a witness in the trial. He would have been a powerful witness, implicating both himself and Pabellon in the murder-for-hire scheme. And then this witness hanged himself in a prison cell.Law enforcement agents and prosecutors have to work with the evidence they have. They do not get to create the evidence they want or need. Fowler and Pabellon had the motive to kill Ricky Samuel, and Fowler had the means and access to do so. But still the trial would be about connecting Fowler to Pabellon. Pabellon did not pull the trigger, but he was the reason the trigger was pulled.The late, great federal prosecutor David C. Stephens and I prosecuted the case together. Stephens told me early on in our preparation that I would be doing the closing argument. All parts of a criminal trial are important, from pretrial motions and jury selection all the way through to the charging of the jury and the deliberations. But the closing argument is the last chance prosecutors get to make their argument to the jury. It is considered supremely important. I had made some closing arguments before but never in a case of this magnitude. And so I began a practice that I came to use in every case I prepared, prosecuted, and tried afterward: I started at the end.I wrote the closing argument first, and then worked my way backward to the beginning of the trial. There were witnesses to be called and examined and cross-examined. There were legal arguments to be made and exhibits to be introduced. I structured the presentation of evidence to get me to my desired ending.The closing argument is last. But it is also most important. I started with what was most important and made sure everything else worked in tandem with that.Starting at the end helped me in that first murder case, and I used that strategy in every trial thereafter. Eventually I embraced the tactic outside the courtroom, and it became the framework I‚Äôve employed in every major life decision I‚Äôve faced since then. Start at the end and then figure out how to get there.The Last SceneOne of the joys of middle age is that sometimes young people mistake longevity for wisdom. As a result, I frequently have young people visit or call, looking for advice on their nascent careers. I let them talk first, and what I typically hear is a confession of uncertainty, anxiety, and apprehension. They are not quite sure what they want to do‚Äîor even who they want to be‚Äîbut someone, somewhere told them they needed to have life figured out at the tender age of seventeen. And the pressure begins to mount, at least in their minds. Sometimes these young people are worried about making money; sometimes they are worried about finding a fulfilling career path. Most are worried‚Äîsome are even paralyzed‚Äîby the fear of making the wrong decisions.I remember one young man who came to see me when I was in Congress. He had life all mapped out, but it required him to gain admittance to one of our military academies. If that did not happen, according to him, nothing else would happen and his life was essentially over (at the age of seventeen) because it all hinged on going to West Point or the Naval Academy. Put aside for a second just how incredibly competitive those schools are and how little control the applicants have over whether or not they are selected. I could not get over his deep belief that all of his hopes and dreams hinged on being accepted at one of two highly competitive and selective schools.My first response had nothing to do with how to gain admittance to a highly selective college or university. I simply asked him where he wanted to wind up. It turned out he wanted to wind up exactly where I was, which was in Congress. ‚ÄúWho told you going to Annapolis or West Point was a necessary condition to running for Congress?‚Äù I asked him. ‚ÄúAnd who told you that even graduating from West Point or Annapolis would guarantee electoral success? And how will that make you a more effective member of Congress even if you are successful in both?‚Äù The real question, I tried to convince him, is not where he would spend the next four years but an even deeper, more significant question. Where did he want to be for his last four years? What did his last four months looks like? Last four minutes? Without being moribund, I wanted him to lean back in that chair in my office, close his eyes, and visualize a picture. The picture I wanted him to paint, with the most vivid details he could conjure, is the final scene.You can do the same.You‚Äôve passed from this world, hopefully after a long, happy, and healthy life, and family and close friends are waiting in a line to receive visitors. There is no more chance to leave a mark, make amends, rethink a decision, or change the story. Imagine the closing argument for your own life.When you think of that funeral scene, place yourself in that room eavesdropping on the conversations. If you see yourself as an angel, that‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt think I will qualify for that title, so I will go with just a spirit or a ghostlike figure lurking above the receiving line, but I want you to answer two questions:What have you accomplished?How are you remembered?Considering what people might say about them at their funeral usually snaps my young visitors to attention. (Or scares them away.) No one really enjoys thinking about the end. It‚Äôs hard and final, and it is understandable that we would rather dwell on happier thoughts. But death is one of the few things that is absolutely guaranteed in our lives, so these are important questions to ask, despite the uncomfortableness of it all. We have to will ourselves to do it‚Äîto think about the closing argument of life so we can structure the evidence and pick the witnesses who will testify about our lives. If life can be compared to a trial and if there is a final argument, a closing statement of sorts, what will be said and is there evidence to support it?The truth is, for many young adults figuring out what they want to do after they turn eighteen, their decisions revolve around vocation. What career field do they want to enter when they graduate? I try to encourage them to think of the other areas of their lives as well. What we seek to accomplish in life, in my judgment, should not be confined to a single area but should span relational, vocational, educational, and personal realms.We are human, of course, and a perfect balance is impossible, but thinking through how the various areas of life co-exist with one another helps give us better direction. If you make a lot of money but have no time for family, will you have accomplished what you want in life? If you are singularly focused on socializing in college and neglect your studies, are you setting yourself up to accomplish everything you want to achieve? All friends and no job is sort of like ‚Äúall hat and no cattle.‚ÄùAt any age, focusing on what we want to accomplish in a variety of areas will help give us that holistic picture as we move through life. When we decide to look at life through the lens of what we want to accomplish rather than simply what we want to do, life gains the significance we covet and our decision making will gain a sense of purpose.I wish I had a nickel for every young person who told me they wanted to make a difference in their community, their state, or their nation. Their motives were pure, near as I could tell. They really wanted to effectuate change. So, I listened and nodded my head as they explained to me why they needed to go to law school, and then go into politics or government, in order to bring about that change our society so desperately needed. And when it was my time to offer advice, it was always the same advice: If you want to change the world, you should teach.Teachers have changed my life more than any United States president or cabinet member. The person I live with, a first-grade teacher, will change the world more in one semester than I did in eight years in the House of Representatives.The prestige of what you do and the importance of what you accomplish are two entirely different things. The sooner we learn that truth, the more fulfilling life will be. If you are going to make the very best decisions in life, you are going to have to be honest with yourself. We all try to say the right things when others are listening. Say the honest thing when it is just you doing the talking and listening. I encourage these young people I have the good fortune to visit with to have a frank conversation with themselves about their real motivations as they relate to the decisions before them.Now, having a clear vision of the end is essential, but the actions you take to bring that image to life are what will determine whether you reach your desired destination. This is one case where it is not merely the thought that counts. You build your closing argument with the daily decisions you make. How you speak to people, how you make others feel, how you conduct your business, how well you take care of yourself and those you love, how much you help those in need, how generous you are with your time or money‚Äîall that is evidence that will be used and relied upon for your own closing argument in life.The things you think, do, and say each day are leading you to your final destination. Your decisions, wittingly or unwittingly made, will guide you somewhere, so I would encourage you not to keep that desired destination a secret‚Äîespecially from yourself. Put another way, the more you think about your closing argument now, the more likely you will be able to shape it between now and when folks put on their Sunday best to bid you farewell.And if we want to make the decisions that lead us to our desired closing arguments, we need to evaluate where we are now‚Äîas in today, the very moment you read this. If you need to change direction or the speed with which you are moving, now is the perfect time to analyze that. Are you happy in your career, school, major, key relationships? When you consider the big things like vocation, family, friendships, business relationships, and marriage, are you on track for your desired closing argument?What Do You Want to Accomplish?There is a tremendous difference between what we ‚Äúdo‚Äù and what we ‚Äúaccomplish.‚Äù Accomplishing something requires intent and purpose. Accomplishing something requires foresight of the ending. When we work toward accomplishing something, we have direction; if we are merely doing something, we are moving without direction, and we are more likely to get lost.For example, when I was considering college majors, I looked at what I needed to do to graduate, which was accrue 120 credit hours, rather than what I wanted to accomplish in life. I chose history because I went to college with six hours of Advanced Placement credit in history from high school, and that credit reduced the number of classes I needed for the major.I would have been much better off, in hindsight, majoring in philosophy so I could learn to think more critically or psychology so I could understand human nature. Thinking critically and understanding human nature are essential to helping people who have been the victims of crime, which is what ultimately wound up being what I wanted to accomplish in life.But still, I found a way to make it work because there are multiple routes to get to a destination. Some poor decisions cost you a lot, and some cost you next to nothing. I majored in history and wound up going to law school and ultimately found a career in the justice system that I loved. Even though I would have done college differently if given the chance, I eventually made sense of the path I chose and got to my destination despite the fact that the path was more circuitous than it needed to be.You are not ‚Äúfinished,‚Äù as that young man tried to convince me, if you don‚Äôt get into an elite military school. Your life is not ‚Äúover‚Äù because you didn‚Äôt get your dream job. You are not free to ‚Äúgive up‚Äù because you did not get an invitation to join this group or club. One misguided decision or unexpected setback might stop you from doing something specific, but it does not hinder you from accomplishing what you want to in life; it might just take you a little longer to get there. All routes may not be equal in length, difficulty, or scenery, but they can get you where you want to be if you are clear on your destination and dogged in your pursuit.Do not forget to consult your dreams. Usually when I ask young people what they hope to accomplish, I can see their eyes light up as they think about what some call dreams and others call goals or aspirations. Some of these young people are reluctant to verbalize those dreams for fear they will be perceived as too wild, fanciful, or unattainable. I am the first one to tell you that logic has a role in decision making. But it is essential and liberating to verbalize what we dream to be or¬†do.Logic and dreams can be roommates. They can be travel companions. That will be a recurring thread throughout this book (although some of the decisions I‚Äôve made in life may seem to indicate that logic was taking a nap while my dreams drove the car). Logic will and should take the lead. But when forming your image of the end and thinking through what you want to accomplish‚Äîwhat you want to be said of you to your family in the receiving line‚Äîit‚Äôs important to give your dreams the freedom to appear, exist, and be respected. Let them roam your mind as you explore where you want to go. Dreams may not dictate short-term decisions, but they help chart the longer course. There may even come that moment in your life when your dreams become real enough or lived enough to say, ‚ÄúWe are here. We finally made it.‚ÄùHow Do You Want to Be Remembered?For me, the picture of the end I envision is my wife and children at the mortuary not far from where we live. I delivered a newspaper early in the mornings to the mortuary office when I was a teenager, so it‚Äôs a familiar and friendly scene. (Well, as friendly as a mortuary can be to a fourteen-year-old on a moped in the dark.) Hopefully, it‚Äôs a sunny day so my wife isn‚Äôt cold, because she would be cold running wind sprints on the floor of an active volcano. The sun definitely needs to be bright and engaged in this photograph in my mind so she is warm and content. Plus, I won‚Äôt be there for her to tell me how cold she is.Ideally the service will be in the middle of the afternoon, so she can work most of the day at the elementary school where she teaches, take a short break for my service, and still get back home in time to watch Love Comes Softly or Love Comes Today or whatever is the most recent iteration of the exact same movie she has seen a trillion times on the Hallmark Channel. And, of course, the sooner the service ends, the sooner she can reach out to Matthew McConaughey on social media to let him know of her newfound availability.In my closing scene, I want it to be clear that I was a prosecutor, that I helped crime victims and their families fight for justice and accountability. I want people to think I was a loving husband to my wife and tried to be a good father to our children. This is the time for those who actually knew me‚Äînot the media, not my critics, not those who proliferate the comment sections of websites or social media posts‚Äîto say what they remember. I can think of nothing less credible than people who never met you or engaged with you describing your life to those who actually did know you. I hope people will say, ‚ÄúHe was funny and fair.‚Äù That would be a nice combination to leave with those I loved. It doesn‚Äôt matter to me whether anyone mentions Congress or not, although someone I met in Congress will be preaching the funeral. Likewise, it is not important to me that television or media be mentioned, although there is nothing in the world wrong with a career in the media, and I‚Äôm grateful for the job. It‚Äôs just that the courtroom is the job that meant the most to me, and therefore the one I hope others will remember.That final picture has the people who knew me best making my wife laugh with a memory or making her proud with a story. Funny and fair. That doesn‚Äôt sound overly ambitious, and, truth be told, that desired closing chapter or final picture may well have been different twenty years ago, before I understood the difference between who we are and what we do for a living. But it is settled now, and it likely won‚Äôt change at this point in my journey.What do you want people to say about you when you are gone? Where do you want to wind up, and what are you currently doing and deciding to make sure you make progress on that journey? Do you know yourself well enough to answer those questions today? Do you know yourself well enough to even ask those questions today?Your picture doesn‚Äôt have to include a funeral or service. It can be a retirement party or a hundredth birthday party or a seventy-fifth wedding anniversary. It‚Äôs not about the event. It‚Äôs about how you live on in the lives and memories of others, how you‚Äôve made an impact, and what you‚Äôve built with your life. You will be remembered by someone and for something. For how long and in what way is up to you. My hope is that our decisions can lead to a legacy that aligns with our dreams and intentions.It‚Äôs worth noting that your picture of the end may well evolve, as mine did, over time. Hopefully, as it changes and grows, there will be a general consistency or theme. As you begin living out your life, your end will hopefully become clearer and more defined. Yes, there will be curveballs and pitfalls. What we plan is not always what actually happens. We need to be capable of adapting, while still keeping our eyes on that end goal and picture.There is a Walmart near the home my wife and I have lived in for close to a quarter century. I frequented this Walmart quite a bit, especially when our kids were young. Our son loved LEGO sets and our daughter loved Barbie dolls and stuffed animals, so I spent lots of time in the toy section specifically. Every time I would haul my kids there to buy them more toys they didn‚Äôt need, we passed a greeter at the door. It was almost always the same greeter. Her name was Frankie, and she always had a story (usually with some length to it), always had some advice for me as a prosecutor, always had a piece of advice for law enforcement that I needed to pass on to the sheriff (preferably immediately), and sometimes had a bit of advice for Sam Walton (even though I repeatedly reminded her that I was not likely to bump into him along life‚Äôs highway).Frankie loved to talk and was always in a happy mood. I can almost guarantee the person you‚Äôre imagining right now, with the type of personality required to be a greeter at Walmart, is pretty accurate. Her liveliness and commentary consistently brought a smile to my face, and she slowly but surely taught me patience.Life moved on. My children grew older and their taste in toys became considerably more expensive. But there was always a reason I needed to go to Walmart, and Frankie was always there at the door. Until she wasn‚Äôt. She had been gone for about a week when, for a reason I don‚Äôt fully understand, I decided to look in a section of the local newspaper I rarely visit: the obituaries. There she was.My wife always has a sense of what the right thing to do is. She suggested the right thing to do was to go pay my respects at Frankie‚Äôs visitation. I did not even know Frankie‚Äôs last name until I read the obituary, and I certainly did not know anything about her family. But my wife said I should go, so I went. I drove to a small funeral home in a rural part of our county. There weren‚Äôt many cars in the lot, and there was no line, making me think I was at the wrong funeral home or had the wrong time. But I followed the signs down the hall and found the room with Frankie‚Äôs casket. There were only a handful of people standing around. No formalities. No service‚Äîor not that night at least. I paid my respects and left shortly thereafter. It struck me as sad that so few other people were there. I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting, but it was different from what I saw.I wish I had spoken to the people there that night. I wish I had talked about the way Frankie approached strangers with friendliness and humor, the way she built relationships in one-minute intervals as people were passing through what she called ‚Äúher door.‚Äù Her legacy influenced the way I view strangers and even the way I view small talk. It‚Äôs actually not always so ‚Äúsmall,‚Äù in hindsight, at least to those with whom you are talking. There are pearls of wisdom in the brief encounters we have in life, and there is never a wrong time to make others feel valued.The truth is, legacy lasts far beyond the words spoken or left unspoken at your funeral. Your closing argument isn‚Äôt just found in what people say‚Äîor how many speak up‚Äîabout you, but in how you made them feel. Frankie‚Äôs closing argument was built from the decision she made every day to show up with a smile, her decision to engage with people some might call strangers, and to remind them of the importance of slowing down and prioritizing human connection. She decided to try to make the world a better place the best way she knew how. She made people feel welcome, and that is one of the best feelings you can give someone.I still think of Frankie frequently when I pass a Walmart. I actually think of Frankie far more often than I do the man who started Walmart. Her memory reminds me to slow down, that it‚Äôs okay to smile from time to time and not always be in such a hurry. Life is not a hundred-meter dash. It‚Äôs okay to talk with the people we are walking this marathon with. I wonder how many other Walmart shoppers were impacted by Frankie the way I was. I bet if they knew she‚Äôd passed away, there would have been a larger crowd at the funeral home that night. But the size of the audience often does not equate to the quality of the performance.If you judge success by public adoration, media attention, fame, wealth, awards, or titles, then I guess Frankie would not be considered wildly successful. If, on the other hand, you measure life‚Äîthe accumulation of the decisions you make‚Äîaccording to the longevity and significance of what is remembered even by a few, then I would say Frankie is still alive and well.You cannot script with precision what‚Äôs going to happen in the end, but by thinking through what you want to be said of you, how you want to be remembered‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs said at your visitation or memorialized in a book years later‚Äîit will give you direction on whether to start, stay, or leave when you find yourself at a crossroads.The Note You End OnWhen writing the closing argument for that first murder trial, there were a number of different angles to choose from. We had hundreds of pieces of evidence. What did I want the jury to be left with? Would it be the fingerprint found in Ricky Samuel‚Äôs Bible? Would it be the symbolism of taking a man to accept Jesus and then putting two bullets in the back of his head, ensuring that he did, in fact, meet Jesus? Would it be the testimony of co-conspirators? Would it be the motive of wanting to eliminate a witness? How could we close this case in the most effective and persuasive way possible?I decided to end with a simple, single photograph of the crime scene.In this photograph, you had the benefit of simplicity, of imploring the jury to simply exercise its collective common sense. Picture the scene in your mind as it was depicted in this still photograph: A young man‚Äôs lifeless body lay mere feet away from a small pond with grass and trees on the periphery. The only evidence contained in that photograph was the body itself. The perpetrator was not in the photograph. The murder weapon was not in the photograph. But that photograph was powerful nonetheless. The loneliness was powerful. The inhumanity was powerful. The weakness of the federal government to protect its own witnesses was powerful.In this photograph there was a reflection off the water of that small pond. The surrounding grass and trees mirrored in that body of water. What if those actually were our witnesses? What if the grass and trees could testify? What would this photograph say if the photograph could speak to us?Indeed, it is speaking to us. It is telling us what happened if we will only listen. That photograph had the water needed for a manufactured baptism. It had the isolation needed for a crime. It had the anonymity someone not from the area would want and need. It had the absence of traditional witnesses. Photographs do not have failed recollections. They are the perfect distillation of a specific time and place. And in that regard, they are the best witnesses you could ever have.Who had the motive to kill Ricky Samuel? Who were the new faces in his life who could lure him to a small body of water miles removed from where he called home? Who did he trust enough to get into a car with and search for a proper baptismal pond? If you could rewind this photograph from when it was taken to when the image was actually created, who do you think would be there? Whose reflection would we see in the pond? And don‚Äôt you think the reflection from the pond belongs to the same person whose fingerprint was found in the book of Ezekiel?Since this was the first murder trial I had ever been part of, I experienced the raw and acute feelings of loss, finality, and loneliness attendant to homicide cases. Seasoned homicide investigators and litigators may eventually grow accustomed to these feelings, but they were brand-new for me, and more importantly, these feelings would be brand-new for the members of the jury. I knew that in order to win the case, I needed my closing argument to appeal to both logic and these raw emotions that would deeply resonate with the jury, the observers, the final decision makers. Throughout the trial, knowing I wanted to end with the photograph, I emphasized the inhumanity of the murder and the events preceding it, and I appealed to the humanity of the jury, empathizing with the emotions that the facts of the case conjured.Something terrible, tragic, and lethal happened by that pond, even if there was no one there to witness it. The absence of human perception does not obviate reality. A life was taken even if there was no one left among the living to tell us who did it.There are always questions at the end of a trial, no matter the amount of evidence produced. People are wired to ask questions. We are, in some ways, wired to see doubt both in ourselves and in others. The photograph allowed the jury to ask all the right questions as they were deliberating. And employing reason, probability, and common sense as they went through the evidence and the testimony would provide the answers to those questions.Bob Harry Fowler and Tommy Pabellon were convicted by a federal jury in Greenville, South Carolina, and given four life sentences for the murder for hire of federal witness Ricky Samuel. I have lost count of the number of homicide cases I prosecuted after Ricky Samuel‚Äôs. But I never lost sight of the tactic that worked, at least for me. Start at the end. What is the last point you want to make, and how can everything else you do and say empower you to make that argument?

Look in the Mirror¬†Your decisions in life will determine your success. But first, your most important decision will determine what success looks like in your life. Define success in terms of what you can control‚Äîyour words, your mindset, your effort. The small decisions we make every day matter: choosing to use respectful language when you get in an argument with your boss, deciding that you are going to be optimistic about the outcomes of the projects you are working on, opting to read this book rather than watch TV, planning to go on dates with or give gifts to your significant other to show you care. When you decide to control your daily actions, you can derive your sense of fulfillment from active choices you make rather than only outcomes, a more stable and sustainable way of approaching success.¬†Pyramids and Tall OrdersWhen I was growing up, my father would regale my three sisters and me with stories about Judge Donald S. Russell, the man for whom the federal courthouse in my hometown of Spartanburg, South Carolina, is named. Judge Russell was someone I admired in large part because of his extraordinary r√©sum√©. I met Judge Russell only once, so it was his known accomplishments that I was most familiar with. He was the governor of the state of South Carolina, the president of the University of South Carolina, a United States senator, a United States district court judge, and a judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, to name just a few.My dad‚Äôs favorite Donald Russell story was that on Saturdays in the fall, Judge Russell would ride from Spartanburg to Columbia with his family for University of South Carolina football games. Once in Columbia, the family would drop Judge Russell off at a library or a park so he could read while the rest of the family went to the football game. Talk about misplaced priorities! Who would possibly pass up a chance to watch a Gamecocks football game to go read yet another book?I think the obvious point of my father‚Äôs story was that Judge Russell highly valued education, both formal and otherwise. The point could also have been that South Carolina was not very good at football back then, so Judge Russell found the library or a park bench more entertaining. If Judge Russell could still value education and reading, even at that point in life, having accomplished all that he had accomplished, surely I would be wise to value it more during my formative years. Education was not a target for Judge Russell‚Äîit was his process. It was not merely something to be obtained‚Äîit was something to be experienced. I understood full well the point of my father‚Äôs story. I just did not apply those lessons to my own life‚Äînot then, at least.For a long time, Judge Russell‚Äôs r√©sum√© and reputation set the standard for what I believed a successful life should look like. I should accumulate one professional accomplishment piled on top of another‚Äîeach step narrowing the path until some pinnacle is reached. Life is a pyramid and the goal is to get to the very top. That is what he had done and that is what I should strive for.The pyramid model of success goes something like this: You are born on the bottom of the pyramid. Most of us are expected to do certain things like graduate high school or avoid interactions with the criminal justice system. For those ‚Äúaccomplishments‚Äù you receive no credit, save that your pyramid remains largely intact. This is the base of the pyramid; it does not distinguish you from others‚Äîit simply keeps you in the game, like the opening ante in a poker match.From there on, each of your decisions becomes a building block in the pyramid, narrowing your path and scaling the heights even as the walk becomes more precarious as you go. Your vocational pursuits become steps toward the top‚Äîeach promotion elevating and distinguishing you even more. Any awards and recognition you receive during your life will help to build your pyramid, separating you from others who may have similar career paths and goals. Finally, at the top of the pyramid is a lasting legacy, a reputation that lives on even after you‚Äôre gone, like having a courthouse named after you. To reach the top of the pyramid is to achieve uniqueness in the purest sense of the word. It indicates that you have done or accomplished things that have not been duplicated by others.Based partly on Judge Russell‚Äôs example, growing up‚Äîand well into adulthood‚ÄîI‚Äôd ask myself: What does the top of my pyramid look like? How am I going to distinguish myself? How many things have I done that others may not have done? I thought I could prove my uniqueness only by doing things others viewed as laudatory or exceptional. It was an exhausting way to go through life.The education part of my pyramid was pretty thin and flimsy. I remember getting the yearbook my senior year of high school. There was a page dedicated to the ‚ÄúTen Most Outstanding Seniors,‚Äù the students who had stood out the most academically, athletically, and otherwise. You will not find my name on that page of our high school yearbook‚Äîor any other page, for that matter, aside from the obligatory class photo, which is sort of tantamount to a participation award. Though I tried to carve out some semblance of a significant existence, my desire for success was overwhelmed by my fear of failure. It‚Äôs really hard to achieve much of note if you never venture or try. Part of you says to go for it, while the rest of you says you will likely fail. And the result was what I perceived as nothingness: no impact, nothing to distinguish myself by. When I received that yearbook in homeroom, I turned through the pages and I saw failure. Anonymity and failure.Our son graduated from the same high school I graduated from about thirty years after I did, and there he was on the page of ‚ÄúOutstanding Seniors.‚Äù The base of his pyramid was already looking different from and much better than his father‚Äôs. But he eschewed that definition of success in life. I doubt he even opened his yearbook, and if he did, I can safely assure you it was not to judge whether he achieved high school fame. Even though he accomplished far more than his father had by that stage, it was inconsequential to him. He, smartly, does not use a pyramid to define a successful life, nor does he allow the editors of a high school annual to determine his worth.But I did then, and I did even after high school. Life went on, and I viewed every new day as just another opportunity to distinguish my existence from that of others. I determined that what I had not accomplished with my decision making in high school and college, I would have to make up for with subsequent decisions. I clerked for a district court judge. Some other people did that too, but not all other people. Then it was off to the United States Attorney‚Äôs Office. There have also been plenty of women and men who clerked for federal judges and went on to become federal prosecutors, but the pyramid was at least getting thinner in my mind. Add to that running for political office, first as state district attorney and later in Congress. With each new endeavor, I was trying to add points of differentiation or distinction that to outsiders would make my pyramid look like a life well spent.Looking at the top of the pyramid may sound like a less morbid way to picture the end than thinking of the receiving line or wake preceding your funeral. You might say it‚Äôs just another way to start with the end goal in mind. But I have found the pyramid to be a faulty model. If you live your life in an effort to be distinct from everyone else, you will live for an external title or reputation rather than an internal purpose or aspiration. You will be relegated to a narrow path. What would life look like if we accepted our uniqueness from the beginning and stopped trying to prove it?Often life handcuffs us with a definition of ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù imprinted in our youth, and we can never seem to outrun it. For me, this pyramid, combined with an innate fear of failure, set an unattainable and exhausting definition for a well-lived life. But for years I couldn‚Äôt shake it. While I don‚Äôt blame the honorable Judge Russell for my unrealistic benchmark for success, his expansive r√©sum√© and substantial reputation left me feeling substandard and inadequate no matter my age or what I actually did achieve.Climbing LaddersAnother popular model of success is a ladder, with every rung representing incremental achievements and increasing power or worth. The ladder is a metaphor typically used to describe professional achievements‚Äîas you get promoted, you continue to climb. It‚Äôs commonly referred to, not surprisingly, as ‚Äúclimbing the ladder of success.‚ÄùI have a few friends who see success according to the ladder model, and some of those people have their sights set on the very top rung of the ladder, as in the most powerful position in the country and, arguably, the world: president of the United States of America.According to the best estimates, 545 million people have been born in or moved to the United States of America since we became a country. There have been forty-six presidencies in that time period, with forty-five different men (for now) having held that position. (As you may recall, Grover Cleveland was president twice but not successively, so we will count him once.)Based on firsthand knowledge alone, I can currently think of no fewer than twenty-five women and men who are considering a run for president in 2024 or beyond. Even more, there are 100 United States senators, 50 governors, 435 members of the House of Representatives, and dozens of ambassadors and cabinet-level officials. It is safe to assume that many of them aspire to be president. And then there are the entertainers, television commentators, radio talk show hosts, and others who believe that they, too, would make a fine leader of the free world.So a lot of people aspire to‚Äîand perhaps even define success as having‚Äîa job where the chances of ‚Äúbeing hired‚Äù are less than the odds of winning the Mega Millions lottery or, to put it more pointedly, being struck by lightning while cashing in your winning lottery ticket.The ladder model is dependent upon outperforming and outachieving other people. First, that‚Äôs not always possible, and second, that leaves a lot of people behind or falling off. All of those aspiring presidents will not be ‚Äúunsuccessful‚Äù in their lives simply because they do not achieve something incredibly difficult to achieve. There must be worth and purpose somewhere besides the top rung of this ladder. There has to be more to life than simply looking and climbing up, not to mention the fact that the higher up the ladder you climb, the farther people get to see you fall.When I reflect on my friends who are contemplating running for the highest office in the land, or running for governor of a state, or whatever is perceived as the highest echelon of their chosen field, I feel the urge to ask them what I am asking you: Do you want the measure of what you accomplish in life to be marked by titles, offices, and achievements? Or do you want what you accomplish in life to be defined by the fight itself, the venture, the challenges, the pursuits that you deemed worthy of your time? Is success what you do or who you are?Of my current friends who look in a mirror and see a potential president of the United States, perhaps one, if he or she is lucky, will ever ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù in my lifetime. Most of them will not even be the nominee of their political party. But that cannot possibly mean that these women and men are failures. My hope for them, and for you, is that they will consider themselves a smashing success simply because they ventured, they tried, and they competed.It‚Äôs a matter of perspective. So, if we can find a way to shift our identity from what we have achieved to what we have ventured to do, then we can begin to make better decisions for ourselves. And if we are able to shift our identity‚Äîthe measure of our own worth‚Äîfrom what we have ventured to do to who we have ventured to become, not in terms of title but in terms of character, then we are able to view success not from the top of a ladder but from the throngs of a fulfilled life, surrounded by friends and family and full of aspirations, ventures, and careers we loved.You can fall off a ladder or a pyramid. Interestingly, the higher you have scaled it, the more painful the fall. Both perspectives on success make shifts in direction seem akin to failure. If you decide to change paths, both models imply that all the work up to that point has been pointless and you are starting at the bottom again. If you decide ten years into your career in insurance that you want to be a romance writer, then you will go back to ground zero‚Äîlike a terrible game of real-life Chutes and Ladders.I would encourage you to eschew both the pyramid and the ladder for something much more likely to get you to your desired closing photograph and summation.Man in the MirrorIn 2015, during my third term in Congress, there was a window of opportunity for me to run for the Speaker of the House of Representatives. There was a path, albeit small, to victory. John Boehner was stepping down. Kevin McCarthy, the clear favorite, had withdrawn from consideration. Paul Ryan was being cajoled to run, but his real desire was to stay where he was as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. So, there was this highly coveted title, with no perceived front-runner, and hence there was a path. That would have certainly helped me build the next level of my pyramid: Speaker of the House, third in line to the president. It might even make up for not appearing on the Outstanding Seniors page of the high school yearbook.Should I start or should I stay? Should I run for a position that presents itself infrequently, if ever? Should I seize that moment to do something no one ever thought me capable of doing? Should I shock every teacher I ever had? Could I forgive myself if I had a life-changing opportunity within arm‚Äôs reach and then decided to withdraw my arm? The pyramid mentality said, ‚ÄúStart. Go for it.‚ÄùBut by that point, I had thankfully traded the lure of a unique pyramid for the steady assurance of a mirror. I no longer felt the need to be different or successful in the eyes of everyone else. I no longer needed a title to set me apart. I simply felt the need to be successful in the eyes of a few, and mostly in my own eyes when I looked in the mirror.It is hard to pinpoint the precise moment I scaled this mountain of change and swapped my external calibration of success for an internal one. From an early age I confused what I did with who I was. I confused what I accomplished or failed to accomplish with my sense of worth. Ironically, I did not do this to others. One of the kindest things I ever heard my father say about me was, ‚ÄúTrey treats the man who owns the building the same way he does the man who cleans the building.‚Äù And my dad was right‚ÄîI did try to do that with almost everyone. Except myself.Once you accept that there is at least one person in the world who genuinely does not care whether you work in the Capitol or manicure the lawns around the Capitol, you can be freed. You can be liberated. That one person for me is my wife, Terri. Throughout our life together and because of the love she‚Äôs shown me, I was able to distance myself from the pyramid model I‚Äôd always subscribed to. I jokingly say that I am not even sure my wife knew I was in Congress for eight years. It‚Äôs just not how she judges me or my worth to her or our children. For her it is your character, not your accomplishments. It is how you act, not what you achieve. Attention and notoriety never meant anything to her. The two men she respected most in life were her father and her brother, and it was not because of anything either of them did, it was because of who they were. It is liberating when you find someone who values you for who you are rather than what you accomplish. And it is even more liberating when you finally begin to listen to that person.It is most liberating when you become that someone for yourself.I went from scaling the pyramid to looking in the mirror when Terri handed me the keys that let me out of that self-styled prison. Someone else can unlock the door of that prison, but you must affirmatively decide to walk out and leave. It‚Äôs not that I didn‚Äôt care anymore about what others thought of me. I did care, to a point. But I was no longer a prisoner of what others thought. I have accepted that my pyramid will look pretty much like everyone else‚Äôs when my time is called. Even if it were distinct, I‚Äôve realized that few people who matter would notice or care.The path of my life no longer needs to be an ascent for me to define it as successful. I now look in the mirror (metaphorically‚Äîyou don‚Äôt get a hairdo like mine by spending a ton of time in front of a mirror) and ask myself: Will I be making this decision for myself or for others? Will this cause a rift in the relationships and things that bring me joy in life? Will I see my family less or not be able to play golf with my son and my friends as often? Does this decision take me on a path that leads me closer to my desired closing argument, to that final photograph in life‚Äôs pictorial? Will I enjoy and find purpose in the reality of this decision (the day-to-day work) or just the concept of it (the title and prestige)?In the case of my opportunity to run for Speaker of the House, when I had the chance to start something new, my mirror said, ‚ÄúStay.‚Äù I had no desire to do all the different work required of the Speaker. I did not want to travel every weekend, trying to help colleagues who had short memories and might not appreciate my help anyway. I did not want to populate committees or referee fights or be responsible for herding the cats in the various factions within the larger Republican conference. The job would not have suited me, nor me it, and the title‚Äîany title at this point‚Äîhad lost its allure.With the mirror model, success‚Äîthe definition of success and the actualization of that success‚Äîcomes from within. Success is not an external monument of your achievements that you‚Äôre constantly building; rather, it is a practice of self-reflection and inner fulfillment enabling you to make decisions that echo your desired path.Now, when people ask me for advice about building a successful life, I tell them the story about the pyramid, the ladder, and the mirror. I tell them the three key ways the mirror is superior (though there are more):It doesn‚Äôt relegate you to a linear track. The mirror recognizes that as you change and grow, so do your dreams and plans. You can still be successful if you decide to change career paths twice over two decades.It enables you to find satisfaction in the phase of life you are currently in. This enables you to be more present and to celebrate and rest in accomplishments for a time.It focuses on the opinions of those who matter. Rather than collecting external titles and achievements, the mirror empowers you to fixate on your purpose and character‚Äîinternal pursuits‚Äîand look to the opinions of those who know you best. You can see others in the mirror‚Äîespecially those closest to you‚Äîand take their reflections into consideration, but your success isn‚Äôt dependent upon anyone else‚Äôs perception, performance, feedback, or praise.Life will not unfold in a straight line. You may start your career as a prosecutor and end up in television. You may major in history because it means less time in the classroom and then find yourself not only getting a law degree but also standing at the front of the classroom, teaching college and law school classes. So long as you look directly to the person in the mirror, you will be able to see more clearly the direction you should go.So, as I ask myself and others who come seeking counsel, I will ask you too: What do you see in the mirror? And do you like it?What to Look ForNow, some of you might be thinking that I only changed my perspective on success after I‚Äôd already climbed, built, and ascended the pyramid. I was a congressman, after all, so it must have been easy for me to say that external accolades don‚Äôt matter when I‚Äôd already achieved what others might deem a successful life. And you‚Äôre not wrong.If someone had presented me with a different model of success when I was younger, I don‚Äôt know that I would have followed it. I would like to think so, but I‚Äôm not sure. I am certain my mom or someone else tried to convince me earlier in life to be the best person I could be and let everything else fall into place after that. The concept of unconditional positive regard, untethered to acts or achievements, is hardly new. But it is difficult to change our thinking when we have been conditioned by others or external factors or culture to see and define success a certain way. It takes time to look at the faults and flaws of our current models and begin to deconstruct them. It takes time to learn the same old lesson that those things do not bring contentment. It takes time to trust ourselves as credible decision makers and definers of our own success. But once I was able to do that, I found myself wishing I had arrived at that place much earlier in life.To define success for yourself, look in the mirror, reflect on your past decisions, and ask yourself some questions: When have you felt most fulfilled and satisfied? What have you done in your life that filled you with a sense of purpose? When have you decided to be or do something solely for someone else, and what were the effects that had on you? Of everything you‚Äôve built and done in your life, what are you most proud of? Have you ever thought an achievement wasn‚Äôt worth the sacrifice? Whose opinions matter most to you, and why? Have you ever made a decision for the benefit of your image in others‚Äô eyes? How did that turn out? Was there any joy, and if so, how long did it last?All of these questions can help you build your own definition of success. And it‚Äôs important to remember that everything you‚Äôve built up to this moment is not wasted or left behind; it is informing what you see when you look in the mirror.What you decide to do in life may still look to others like the standard ladder; you may achieve success in the world‚Äôs eyes. But let that be an ancillary benefit, not the goal. My father either did not want me to attend the University of South Carolina undergrad or he forbade me to apply, depending on whose version of the facts you adopt. That is, in a real sense, how I wound up at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. My father did not want me to attend South Carolina even though he had, and he loved that school with all his heart. He was probably right. I would not have done well being around high school friends for those four years. So off to Texas I went. But I did make it to South Carolina‚Äôs law school, which was at the time the only law school in the state, so that was sort of a combination of necessity and opportunity. In May 2022, I made it back to the University of South Carolina for one final commencement exercise. The president and the board of trustees gave me an honorary doctorate for public service. To be clear, I did not and do not deserve it, but I am going to keep it anyway.I did not take my parents with me to the ceremony. I did not tell them about it ahead of time. I had to work my tail off to convince my wife to stay home. I don‚Äôt think I even mentioned it to my children. I did not care then, or now, whether anyone else knew about it‚Äîexcept my parents, after the fact. That was my goal‚Äîto make up for the mediocrity that prevented me from getting an undergraduate degree there earlier in life by returning later in life and getting an honorary doctorate. So there I was onstage, sitting a seat away from the president in between the chairman of the board and a past chairman of the board, both of whom were from the area my parents grew up in. That was why I went, for my parents. Because it meant something to me to do something for them. Although being called Dr. Trey sounds a lot like Dr. Dre, which is pretty cool too.Carve Your PathI used to feel an enormous amount of awe and pressure when I thought about Judge Russell. I pictured him on top of a pyramid when, in reality, he was sitting on a park bench reading a book during a football game. If we focus too much attention on artificial measures of success, we can lose sight of the most important thing, which is the people themselves. Now when I think of Judge Russell, I picture him reading peacefully in a park, enjoying the fullness of a football-less life. Sure, others named a federal courthouse after him, but he wasn‚Äôt sitting in that eponymous courthouse reading a book. He was sitting on a nameless park bench. That is what he valued. That is what I should have seen when I thought of him all along.Your reasons to start something new shouldn‚Äôt be dependent on anyone you can‚Äôt see clearly in your mirror. Your decisions do not always need to make sense to everyone else. They should, of course, be carefully considered and rooted in rational thought. But it is your life, and you only get one‚Äîand when you only have one of anything, you should treasure it and be a good steward of it.What you find significant and how you define success will likely not fall in line with what others deem significant or successful. That can be an apt measure of good decision making. Carve your own path, look in the mirror often, and don‚Äôt get distracted by the ladders and pyramids that others are trying to convince you to climb or construct.

### ‚ú® People‚Äôs feedback can spur you on, encourage you, verify you‚Äôre on the right track, or help you adjust your direction, but, ultimately, if you know yourself and have a deep sense of purpose in the decisions you make, then the verdict of your closing argument will be crystal clear.Advice for My Younger SelfHave you ever seen those celebrity interviews where the interviewer asks, ‚ÄúIf you could go back in time and have a talk with your younger self, what would you say?‚Äù My initial response to such questions is, ‚ÄúMy advice to my younger self would be to skip this interview when it is offered so I don‚Äôt have to answer stupid questions about talking to my younger self!‚ÄùBut, in some ways, it is the perfect question for us to ask ourselves at life‚Äôs markers.


The Other Side of the Period¬†In life, you will lose. You will make mistakes, and you will make wrong decisions. You will suffer pain and loss. There may be some who judge you a failure, or, worse yet, you may fail by your own standards from time to time. How you respond in the aftermath of your decisions is critical to how you move toward your closing argument. Keep venturing, keep trying, and make sure you are controlling fear and fear is not controlling you.¬†Final ChapterSo here we are in the final chapter of a book talking about the final chapter of life. I will repeat the caveats here. I am not an expert at making decisions or weighing and balancing competing factors. And even if I were an expert, that fact would do you little good as you navigate the circumstances of your own life.My motivation to write this book actually began with a poorly made decision to go to the store with my wife and ended with the most cathartic exercise I could have possibly engaged in: honestly evaluating decisions made throughout life, along with their inherent motives, costs, benefits, and consequences. In essence, through the course of this book, I did what I am imploring you to do: Take charge of writing your closing argument.I knew better than to go to the grocery store with Terri. I had made that terrible decision a thousand times before and swore each time never to make it again. She makes every mistake you can possibly make at the grocery store. She makes eye contact with others, which encourages them to speak. She sounds interested in their stories and reacts with excitement to long tales about children and grandchildren, which encourages them to speak longer. She refuses to squeeze through narrow openings in between other shoppers‚Äô carts and mumbles about patience or waiting your turn or something else like that. So we do not shop together.When we did go to the grocery store together, we reached a compromise. She could ride with me, stay in the truck while I went inside, and text me continuously as she ‚Äúremembered‚Äù things we needed but had forgotten to write down. And she could decipher what she had written on her grocery list in the likely event that there was no expert in hieroglyphics at the store that day. Her handwriting is beautiful‚Äîit‚Äôs just illegible.It was a normal spring day in early 2021‚Äîwell, as normal as life could be during a pandemic. Off we went. I was checking out and pushing my shopping cart toward the sliding glass door when an older woman approached me and said: ‚ÄúI know who you are, even with your mask on. You are the district attorney.‚Äù‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam, I used to be, but I am not anymore.‚Äù‚ÄúWhen did you leave?‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt want to embarrass her so I said, ‚ÄúOh, just a little while ago.‚Äù In fact, it had been over a decade.‚ÄúYou did a good job. We thought you were fair.‚ÄùI thanked her, bid her farewell, and walked out the sliding doors into the parking lot toward my truck.But she was not through. She followed me and asked, ‚ÄúSo what did you do after you left the courthouse?‚ÄùThis one is hard. Politics is so divisive, and I did not want to have a conversation about Washington or party lines, so I just said, ‚ÄúI did a little stint in another branch of government, but I‚Äôm happy to be home now. I teach a class at a local college and practice a little bit of law.‚Äù‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt want to be a judge?‚Äù she asked. She was very astute. Almost all lawyers want to be judges, don‚Äôt they? Especially me, who had an almost lifelong infatuation with the federal bench.‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam, I thought I did, but now I just teach a class at a school and a couple of other little things.‚ÄùWe kept talking in the parking lot, and she ended by saying, ‚ÄúWell, I am sure you will find something else to run for, won‚Äôt you?‚Äù‚ÄúNo, ma‚Äôam, I‚Äôm done with all of that. I‚Äôm going to stay right here in Spartanburg with you.‚ÄùWhen I returned to the truck my wife asked, ‚ÄúWho were you talking to?‚Äù‚ÄúI have no idea, honey. I‚Äôve never seen her before in my life, and I didn‚Äôt catch her name.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat did she want?‚Äù‚ÄúNothing, just to talk. She thought I was still the prosecutor, but she also said she thought I was fair, which is nice.‚ÄùI realized in that grocery store parking lot that my decisions in life were not rooted in ambition, not anymore. They were rooted in a desire to have something more meaningful than that. Here I was, sitting in a truck with the person I love more than anyone in life, in the town I love more than any other town, and a woman I‚Äôve never met, who at first glance one might conclude did not have much in common with me, just said I was fair. Maybe those decisions made and not made were not so bad after all.There are natural punctuation marks at various stages of life. The end of high school marks the end of adolescence. (An exclamation point.) The end of college marks the beginning of adulthood. (A question mark.) There is for some of us the parenting period of life, and it overlaps with the vocational period of life. (A question mark followed by an exclamation point.) There is the death of a parent, when we begin to reflect more on our own mortality. (Ellipses.) Children leave and grandchildren arrive. (A semicolon.) Each of those is an appropriate marker to reflect the trajectory of our lives. Depending upon your own life experiences, those life passages may include commas or semicolons, exclamation points, question marks, or even dashes, but not periods.There is but one period.And we do not get to see what is written or said on the other side of that period. Yet it is what will last, so we would be wise to influence it as much as we possibly can. We should punctuate our life so that when that final period is placed, it finishes a complete sentence preceded by a powerful paragraph.I have lived in fear and then forced that fear to remodel itself into something more healthy, called caution. I then watched as caution improved both my decision making and my life, whereas fear had been the unjust warden of both. I have confused titles with jobs, dreams with reality, and success with significance, and emerged to live on the other side with greater clarity and mostly invisible scars.I have taken jobs I should have skipped and left jobs I should have kept, and found that it all worked out okay in the end regardless. I have made the right decision for the wrong reasons, the wrong decision for the right reasons, and more often than not have had a really tough time telling the two apart. I have lost by winning and I have won by losing and learned the most valuable lesson of all, which is: Who gets to define those terms in my own life? Only me.All of which brings me to the heart and mind of the matter: What will you be remembered for, and what role do you want to play in that?As you present your closing argument to the world through your life decisions, don‚Äôt confuse wanting to leave a legacy with caring about what other people think of you. Worrying about others‚Äô perceptions of you and your decisions will only confuse your inner compass. A legacy is not purely for others to see the work that you did and praise you or criticize you; a legacy is a life built around a purpose that betters the world around you. People‚Äôs feedback can spur you on, encourage you, verify you‚Äôre on the right track, or help you adjust your direction, but, ultimately, if you know yourself and have a deep sense of purpose in the decisions you make, then the verdict of your closing argument will be crystal clear.Advice for My Younger SelfHave you ever seen those celebrity interviews where the interviewer asks, ‚ÄúIf you could go back in time and have a talk with your younger self, what would you say?‚Äù My initial response to such questions is, ‚ÄúMy advice to my younger self would be to skip this interview when it is offered so I don‚Äôt have to answer stupid questions about talking to my younger self!‚ÄùBut, in some ways, it is the perfect question for us to ask ourselves at life‚Äôs markers. It helps us sort out perceived failures and the difference between regrets and remembrances. It is a great measure of whether our mistakes defined us, propelled us, or thwarted us. It reminds us that equally important when making decisions is how we think about the aftermath of those decisions.This is oversimplistic, but I suspect about half the world is motivated by a desire for success and half the world is motivated by a fear of failure. Understanding which camp you are in can be liberating and instructive. I am afraid of failing. I have identified that as my source of motivation‚Äîa fear of failing. So fear has played a role in my decision making for as long as I can recall. Perhaps you live with fear too. Let it ride. Let it whisper. Do not let it drive or yell. If you have spent a lifetime being motivated by a fear of failure, nothing I can tell you or write to you will change that. But I would encourage you to do what I have done, which is reach a peace of sorts with fear. Let it look, let it edit, but do not let it write the closing chapter of your life.As you now know, I almost dropped out of my first‚Äîand what would have been my last‚Äîpolitical race simply because I did not want to be a failure on a massive scale in my small hometown. In sum, I did not care if the world thought I had ever won, I just did not want the world to think I was a loser or had failed.Another example of this fear played out in what should have been my first political race but wasn‚Äôt. When I was leaving the ninth grade and heading to high school, my mom came into my room, sat on the side of the bed, and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ask you to do very much, do I?‚Äù‚ÄúNo, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù I lied. (Asking me to be nice to my three sisters for an entire day was a lot to ask.)‚ÄúWell, I am going to ask you to do something, and I want you to do it, for me. I want you to run for student council this year at Spartan High.‚ÄùSpartanburg High School was a big school in 1980. There were hundreds of students in my grade alone. I was not a great athlete. I was not a scholar. I did not consider myself part of the popular crowd (more like one or two tiers below the group that was considered ‚Äúpopular‚Äù). Therefore, I was not likely to be elected to student council.It‚Äôs one thing merely to know in the quietness of your soul that you cannot do something. In that case, you can present the fa√ßade to other people that it might be possible, but you are simply not interested enough to venture into it. Feigned apathy is powerful camouflage.It is completely different to both know you would be unsuccessful and have that knowledge publicly validated by the election results. What I knew was that I was not going to run for student council, not that year, not any year, and certainly not at that high school.It wasn‚Äôt simply a fear of failing. Of course, I had failed before (trigonometry and biology leap to mind), but those were private failures. What my mom was asking me to do would have been a public failure. And consequently, I decided to avoid failure by not running, by not taking any risks‚Äîexcept the risk of disappointing my mother.I gave my mom all the reasons I could not run. I told her it would ‚Äúinterfere with work after school,‚Äù and ‚Äústudent council members had to get there too early in the mornings, and I had a paper route.‚Äù She was persistent. She offered to come up with a catchy slogan or help me create campaign posters. She offered to, in essence, be my first campaign manager. I could tell in her eyes and in her voice‚Äîand mostly in her disappointment‚Äîthat she really wanted me to do this. I do not know why it was so important to her, but it was. I think in some ways she would have been prouder of my being on student council than being in Congress!The look on my mother‚Äôs face is still etched in my mind. It is my original memory of hurting my mom‚Äôs heart, though I‚Äôm sure it wasn‚Äôt the first time. Being kicked out of a kindergarten class for jerking a book out of my teacher‚Äôs hands probably hurt her too. But that moment, as she perched on the edge of my bed and asked me to run, is the first time I recall knowingly disappointing my mom. I can still feel the weight of her sadness. My fear of failure overrode doing what the person who meant the most to me in life wanted me to do.The decision to forgo politics at Spartan High was more than forty years ago. The kid who would rather disappoint his mom than risk perceived embarrassment in front of some teenagers grew up. And along the way, I have made thousands of decisions, including decisions to run for offices arguably higher than student council at a local high school (although my mom and perhaps you would disagree with that hierarchy).How do you go from being terrified at the prospect of not having your name called out on the intercom during announcements the morning after school elections to running for office against two incumbents in a primary? The fear of failing at a small level at a single high school pales in comparison to the fears associated with running for countywide or federal office. And yet I ran for the latter and avoided the former.The behavior change comes when you change how you define success and failure and separate it from your identity. I still fear public failure. I just have redefined what failure is, and I‚Äôve changed who gets to decide whether I failed or not. I separated failing from losing. I separated episodic failures from general, wholesale failure. If we desire to make good decisions, then just as important as how we define success is how we define failure.The advice I would give to my younger self who was avoiding failure by refusing to run for student council would be: Redefine success and don‚Äôt let failure be determined by what others perceive. Failure now is making decisions grounded in fear. Success is venturing, competing, trying, answering the bell even if the scoreboard isn‚Äôt what you want when the final whistle blows. There is no shame in starting a new business and misjudging the market. There is no shame in starting at one college and finishing at another. We must find a way to shift our identity from what we have succeeded at in the world‚Äôs eyes to what we have ventured to do.The definition of success must come from you, and likewise, you and you alone can define what failure is. For me, today, failure is living an inconsequential life. Failure is never venturing, never trying, and never risking anything. Failure is leaving no mark anywhere or, worse yet, leaving a legacy of pain meted out to others. Failure is having no code by which you lived your life.One of my favorite stories in the Bible is perhaps no one else‚Äôs favorite story in the Bible. It is the story of an insurrectionist named Barabbas. He is mentioned in all four of the Gospels after Jesus is arrested. Pontius Pilate, the governor of the Roman province of Judea and the official who presided over Jesus‚Äôs trial, did not believe Jesus was guilty of anything except perhaps unsettling the religious leaders of His time. Pontius Pilate didn‚Äôt want Jesus‚Äôs blood on his hands or a revolution from the people in the crowd, so he gave the decision to the people: They could free Barabbas, a person referred to as a ‚Äúnotorious prisoner‚Äù and a ‚Äúkiller,‚Äù or they could free Jesus, a teacher and performer of miracles. Pretty clear-cut political race: Pick a murderer or the man who said He was the Son of God. Except the crowd picked Barabbas. Jesus lost a voice vote. He lost a popular election, if you will, to a notorious killer, and he was executed, never reaching forty years of age. And yet, there is no name more revered in history than that of Jesus. Even aside from one‚Äôs spiritual beliefs, no name left its mark on the world more than the name Jesus.Dietrich Bonhoeffer also never lived to see his fortieth birthday. He was hanged by the Germans toward the end of World War II. His crime? He fought against the systematic extermination of a people. If you are looking for a motto to guide your life, a code by which you can judge the significance of existence, perhaps it would be what Bonhoeffer said: ‚ÄúThis is the end‚Äîfor me, the beginning of life.‚Äù The end for him was hanging from a rope surrounded by Nazis with the Allies closing in on liberating a continent. Bonhoeffer ‚Äúlost‚Äù before that liberation came. Except he didn‚Äôt lose at all. We are still motivated by his courage and teachings.Martin Luther King, Jr., started a nonviolent movement for equality, was imprisoned, and also did not make it out of his thirties before he was assassinated. He is one of the most revered historical figures of all time. He died on the balcony of a hotel before he could see the fruits of his sacrifice and labor.Three men, none of whom made it to their fortieth birthday, all changed the course of history. Success by any reasonable definition. They died by acts of violence. They died young. But history will record them so long as there is history.Failure cannot simply be losing. It cannot be suffering. It cannot be leaving. It cannot be subordinating yourself to a higher good and eschewing the trappings of a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù life. Failure is not the short end of a vote tally. It is not going to prison. It is not going to the gallows. Failure is sitting still and doing nothing while opportunities to make some difference abound. It is tying failure to your identity and remaining immobile from indecision because of that.Steven Pressfield is one of my favorite authors for many reasons. He wrote a book called The Virtues of War, wherein he tells the story of Alexander the Great coming into contact with someone who did not see fit to include ‚Äúthe Great‚Äù as part of his name.Alexander the Great sought to cross a small footbridge; he was going in one direction and a wise man was coming from the other direction. There was not enough room for both; one would have to relent and go back. One of Alexander the Great‚Äôs men said, in essence, ‚ÄúMake way. Do you not know who is coming? It is the most powerful man in the world, for he has conquered the world.‚Äù To which the wise man responded, ‚ÄúThen I must be the most powerful man in the world because I have conquered the need to conquer the world.‚Äù[*] Let that sink in for a moment. ‚ÄúI have conquered the need to conquer the world.‚Äù He redefined success. He redefined what it meant to lead a significant life. He redefined power and relevance, with just a simple rejoinder.Truth be told, it is likely no one reading this book‚Äîand certainly not the person writing it‚Äîwill be remembered for the duration or depth of Jesus, Pastor Bonhoeffer, Dr. King, or Alexander the Great. We will not conquer the world. I suggest we settle for conquering our own definition of success, and to do that, we must also conquer our own definition of failure.Every one of us has ‚Äúfailed‚Äù and will again, in that we will be on the short end of a score or a business deal or a card game. We will decide to leave of our own volition, and we will be pushed out. We will start something and not reach all our goals. We will stay somewhere too long and pay the consequences. But if we are being true to ourselves and our values, then none of those are considered failures, because we ventured. We tried. We competed.When the Time ComesI hope your closing argument is a long way off, I hope you make hundreds of thousands of decisions between now and then, and I hope you can go into each decision with a little more confidence now. There are a thousand ways to get to your final scene‚Äîyour best closing argument‚Äîand the route you choose through your decisions to start, stay, or leave will dictate what kind of shape you are in when you get there. But eventually, you will get there.For me, I hope people will remember that I tried to be fair. I tried to be an effective advocate for those who could not stick up for themselves. I see a final picture with John Ratcliffe talking to Ben Gramling about something funny I may have said during a round of golf. I see a final picture with my family and closest friends gathered around. I hear someone say, as the woman in the parking lot did, ‚ÄúHe was fair.‚Äù Funny and fair. That‚Äôs all I need to see or hear to believe I have made the right decisions for my life.What do you see?Who do you hear?Can you set that destination in your own life and make calculated decisions to get you there?I cannot answer any of those questions for you, nor can I set the right expectations for your life. You have to know yourself well enough to say yes, no, maybe, or not now to the opportunities presented to you in life.I have never passed Alexander the Great on a footbridge. I have passed the younger version of myself. The old Trey said, ‚ÄúIt will all be okay if you have a plan and a purpose, and you start with the end in sight.‚ÄùThe young Trey said: ‚ÄúWhat took you so long to figure that out?‚ÄùSKIP NOTES* Steven Pressfield, The Virtues of War: A Novel of Alexander the Great (New York: Bantam Books, 2005), 312.
