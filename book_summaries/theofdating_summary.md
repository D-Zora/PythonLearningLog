The Introduction You Can't Skip Monica’s story, or how this book got startedIt was one of those early fall Boston days a few years ago when you thought anything was possible. The sky was unusually clear, the air was crisp, and Newbury Street was humming with life and brimming with attractive people.  I was excited about meeting up with my college classmate Monica, whom I had not seen since we had both graduated from Harvard.You probably know Monica, or someone like her. She is smart, good-looking, funny, in great shape, well-read, stylish, successful – the total package. She had her act together – so much so that guys in college had been almost too intimidated to ask her out. We met at the sidewalk café Sonsie to catch up. And as we discussed work, family, friends, and love life, the question came up: “So – you seeing anyone?”              There was a shifting in the chair, a looking away, and Monica mumbled, "Well, no, not really."  Now, normally that’s not a remarkable fact.  But Monica is kind of a remarkable woman.  Some might even say a serious babe.  If she was perpetually single, something must have been seriously wrong with the world.              Then I started having conversations like that one with other female friends, and a pattern started to emerge.  Talented, educated, attractive women were having unfulfilling dating lives on an epidemic scale.  They either couldn't find the right guy, were with the wrong guy, had relationships that didn't last, or had given up entirely on the whole dating business.               This came to me as a surprise.  I mean, these were all exceptional women.  There should have been a line of fantastic guys around the block for any one of them.  And yet, they were alone.  And lonely.  Surely something was terribly wrong with the world.  So I had to ask – what's going on here?  That’s when I thought there may be a need for a dating guide specifically geared for smart professional women. A guy, writing a dating book for women?As it turns out, my guy classmates were having similar issues, so I started out by writing the book for men, which I finished in three intense months of writing and research in 2005.  The book was well-received, and in late 2006, I set out to write the Tao of Dating for women, thinking that it would take about the same amount of time.  Piece of cake, right?  Wrong.  Turns out it’s not as easy as I thought to write a dating book for women when you’re not a woman.I was seriously stuck for a long time.  More than once I considered abandoning the project.  I mean, what does a guy know about the inner lives of women anyway?  Surely there were 3.5 billion people out there better-qualified to write this book[1].In the meantime, because of the success of the men’s book, I was getting daily letters from men about their dating woes.  And they were having said woes with women, shockingly enough.  Little by little, from these thousands of men, a database started to emerge: what they really liked, what they didn’t like so much, and what absolutely sent them running for the hills.  As their confidante, I also became privy to their innermost thoughts desires, and schemes.  Could this be of interest to my female readers?  Perhaps. Holly’s story, or how this book got finished              Then, something else happened.  Fast-forward to 2008.  The book is still slogging along, and I was visiting Boston, having relocated to Los Angeles in the interim.  I was having dinner with two of my college classmates, Ariela and Holly.  Both are professional women in their thirties, both charming, sweet, fabulous-looking and divorced.  Ariela is single without kids; Holly has a daughter and is seeing someone.  Let’s call him Tim.  Ariela clearly does not approve of Tim, so I decide to get the full story.              “Tell me about this guy,” I ask Holly.  She responds, “Well, he’s really tall and handsome; the sex is great; he’s really sweet most of the time; he’s a bit of the starving-artist type, and he’s not as successful as I am, so I’ve been supporting him for the past couple of years.”  So far, so bad.  I sensed she was holding back, and called her on it.  And – really sweet most of the time?  What’s up with that?“Well, when we first met he was just such a sweetheart.  But lately he’s been sniping at me, putting me down for no reason.  And when I spend time with my friends he gets really jealous and makes me feel guilty.”“Tell him what happened when your daughter fell down the stairs,” said Ariela with a fire of barely concealed rage in her eyes.Holly hesitated.  “Well, last month my daughter fell down the stairs at home and cut her head open.  There was blood everywhere, and we rushed her to the hospital.  I was so shaken, and I just needed Tim to be by my side, so I called him up.  He didn’t come.” Didn’t come?  Just like that?  And you’re still dating this deadbeat?“He said he was afraid of blood, and he just couldn’t deal with the situation.”My heart sank.  How was this possible?  Why was this amazing woman wasting another minute of her life on this unworthy man?  What else is happening that she’s not sharing with us?  How many other women like her were stuck in the same place?  At this point, Ariela and I made a very clear case for why Holly needed to break it off with this guy immediately.  Then Ariela looked me in the eye and held my right forearm for emphasis: “Ali, you have a duty to finish this book as quickly as possible.” I realized that if my book could help even one woman like Holly (and Monica) reclaim their power, then I had to complete it and bring it to light.  Two months after that talk, I finished The Tao of Dating.  And Holly asked Tim (who turns out was also physically abusing her) to move out and never contact her again, not a minute too soon. A dating guide for the modern smart, professional, educated woman              Although Monica and Holly were just two of the women amongst the dozens I spoke to, their cases were not unique.  Their stories all shared common themes.For most of the women there were external circumstances such as focus on their careers that accounted for part of what was happening.  But I was also hearing excuses from them that didn't make a lot of sense: "There aren't any good men."  "I don't have time to meet people."  "I'm an old-fashioned girl – dating's just not my thing."  Or the worst, from those who were dating the wrong guy: “But he’s nice sometimes.”  Some of them genuinely didn't know how to date effectively.  And they weren't entirely at fault: the rules of dating are unwritten, and no one had bothered to teach any of us what they might be.  But even more important, I witnessed that they had abdicated their own power as women and people.  While I saw them as tremendously attractive, magnetic individuals that any man would be lucky to associate with, they did not.  As a result, they ended up alone or with the wrong guy.              So this book has two objectives: to help educated, intelligent, discriminating women get back their personal power in the dating arena and beyond; and to give them some solid strategies for realizing a fulfilling dating life.  As a man, I wish to provide a fresh perspective on women's strength and beauty that they may have forgotten themselves and also provide the man's perspective on which dating strategies work best.              Since writing The Tao of Dating For Men three years ago, I have been privy to hundreds of stories of men's challenges relating to women.  I combined that with my own  experiences to give you a sense of what works best with educated, intelligent, successful men of integrity when it comes to dating.  As a hypnotherapist, seminar leader and personal success consultant, I want to give you tools to re-claim your personal power in all areas of your life.  If you’re reading this book, chances are you are a remarkable woman, and I want to make sure you remember that.  Think of this book as what a big brother with your best interest at heart would tell you if he had a thorough knowledge of the male psyche and had experienced several dates himself.  Seeing you happy makes me happy.              Some time ago, I was introduced to Taoist philosophy and found much wisdom in its lighthearted yet practical way of viewing the world.  As its title suggests, this book draws on Taoist philosophy, which arises from observation of the way the world works.  As such, it is more about the way things are, rather than the way things should be – more descriptive than prescriptive, more empirical than theoretical.  Like Taoism, there is no doctrine, no dogma, and few rules.  In fact, at every point, I encourage you to test the ideas and find out how well they work for you instead of blindly accepting them at face value.  If it works for you, keep it.  If it doesn't, toss it and try something else.                Like the teachings of the Eastern masters and the Tao Te Ching, the concepts may seem paradoxical at first.  I urge you to find the hidden truth behind the paradox.  You may also find that some of these ideas go directly against your expectations or beliefs.  In those cases, I encourage you to just test them out, without any prejudice as to whether they are right or wrong: just see what happens.  As Albert Einstein said, "If at first the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it."  Ordinary ideas and measures will give you ordinary results at best.  Extraordinary results, on the other hand, require extraordinary measures.  As such, the more an idea challenges your current belief set, the more likely it is to effect breakthrough in your life.              You should think of the ideas in this book as tools for achieving whatever your dating goals may be, from a fling to marriage.  I've based these concepts in ancient wisdom along with proven science to ensure that they are as timeless and universal as possible – as likely to be true a hundred years from now as they are today.  As such, although the book is based on a North American model of dating, most of the principles are applicable regardless of who or where you are.  At the same time, I make some assumptions about you, the reader: 1) You are interested in long-term fulfillment as opposed to short-term gain.  There are two operating words here: long-term and fulfillment.  As with investment and career choices, the tactics for short-term gain in dating tend to be different from the ones for long-term benefit.  Also, it's important to remember that fulfillment is not a person – it is a feeling.  And sometimes the way to have that fulfillment will seem paradoxical (e.g. spending some quality time alone).   2) For the purposes of long-term relationships, you are interested first and foremost in a Good Guy.  A Good Guy is a man (as opposed to a boy) who knows what he wants and knows where he's going.  He has a strong internal compass guiding him along his life's purpose, he's completely comfortable in his own skin, and he's a leader.  At the same time that he's a perfect gentleman, always having your well-being in mind, he's perfectly willing to give you some gentle ribbing every once in a while.  He exists in contradistinction to such male archetypes as the Bad Boy, Man-Child and Nice (But Kind of Wimpy) Guy. 3) You are open both to scientific concepts and spiritual principles and are willing to try on novel ideas that are likely to bring more fun and fulfillment into your life.  If you're more scientifically-oriented, consider this an introduction to spiritual concepts.  If you're more spiritually-oriented, consider this a chance to delve into your scientific side.               In the end, this book is more about helping you find your own way than about telling you what to do.  Sometimes we can get stuck in a rut, and all it takes is a tiny jolt, a little piece of information, to get us up and running again.  Many people are finding that jolt amongst the precepts of Eastern wisdom, and if you're reading this, it's likely that you are one of them.              Some of you will find The Tao of Dating highly applicable to where you are and where you want to be, and some perhaps less so.  As for me – I have been through 21 years of formal education, attended countless lectures and gone through thousands of books in my lifetime.  It’s safe to say that I have not used 100% of everything that I have learned.  But I still seek out new sources of information, sit through weekend-long seminars and sift through new books.  Even if I get one new idea, one mental shift to see something in a new way, one re-iteration of a key concept that I had forgotten, or one new application of a concept, then that exercise has been worthwhile.  I urge you to look at any new learning experience in that way, including this book.  New concepts sometimes take time to digest and results may be subtle at first, so go easy on yourself.              One spark is sometimes all it takes to start a raging fire, and I sincerely hope that you will find many sparks in the time you spend with this book.  I congratulate you on making the decision to bring the Tao into your life today.  Once you allow it, you will find that it will empower you and change your life in ways you had not imagined before.  The five themes of The Tao of Dating              This book is organized around five overarching themes.  We will go over each one in detail in the book, but I want to prime your mind so you pay closer attention each time they appear:   • The first is wealth-consciousness, or the mindset of abundance.  There is enough of everything to go around for everyone.   • The second is the Be-Do-Have mentality, which relates to Napoleon Hill’s famous saying from Think and Grow Rich: “Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.”   • The third is enlightened self-interest, which is about acting with your long-term well-being in mind.    • The fourth is feminine-masculine (yin-yang) polarity. • The fifth is getting out of your own way. How to use this book              The purpose of The Tao of Dating is not just to give you some tricks and hints for you to scrape by on, but rather to turn you into the most empowered, fulfilled version of you possible.  As such, this book is equally about transformation and information.  In order to effect that transformation, you have to apply the principles in the book to your life.                So I want you to approach this book less as a novel that you read once and shelve and more like a handbook, travel guide or cookbook.  Mark up the chapters and exercises that you like and come back to them.  I've read the Tao Te Ching at least 300 times, and I keep on coming back to it, just because something in there always provides me with a new perspective on what's happening.  Think of this book in that vein – a reference you will keep on coming back to.                Now if you’re like most people, you are probably going to start reading the book, get to an exercise, skip it, and go straight to the juicy parts about tips and tricks.  So go ahead and do that – I won't tell anyone.  Skim the book once from beginning to end.  Then go back and do the exercises.  That is where the transformation occurs (and where some of the tips and tricks are hidden).                The Tao of Dating contains a lot of information.  If you attempt to remember and try out every idea at once, it may be overwhelming.  That is why the book is organized in a linear fashion.  Start from the beginning, from the work on values, beliefs, attitudes and what you want.  Then move on to the section on how to find quality men.  Progress stepwise to meeting men, attracting them, and perpetuating your relationships with them.                Think of it as baking bread.  If you’ve never done it before, you start by thinking about a recipe.  You then go through each step of making the bread in order: go to store, buy ingredients, mix them, make dough, bake, eat.  If you try to do everything at once, you’re more likely to end up with a mess in the kitchen than an edible loaf.  But if you proceed sequentially, at every step of the way you just have to remember what the next step is.  As Lao Tzu says, “The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.”  Go easy, and good fortune.                I’m very interested in your thoughts about this book, so do me a favor and drop a line sometime.  Just put 'Question', or 'Comment' or 'That was awesome can I buy you a drink'  in the subject line of your email so I know to pay special attention to it.

Chapter 1. Dating for Fulfillment Which would you prefer: the menu or the food?              Imagine that you’re hungry right now at a diner.  And they offer you just the menu but no food.  Would you settle for that?  Or would you demand actual food?                That may seem like a silly question.  But in real life, people sometimes operate as if they aren't sure about the answer.  They chase down the symbol representing what we want – money, titles – instead of the actual thing that we want.  But the money and the titles are only as good as the feelings and experiences they can get for us.                So while reading this book, I'd like you to keep in mind what constitutes real fulfillment for you in the dating realm – the actual food, not the menu.  Because fulfillment is not a person – it's a feeling.  The right person is the one who catalyzes an abundance of fulfilling feelings in your life, like love, peace and contentment.  If you're not getting those feelings, it may be a sign that you're either with the wrong person or that you could approach matters with an even better perspective.              Square one: accept and love yourself now              Some argue that the ultimate aim of everything we do in life is to get more love.  You could be reading this book because you want more love from men, more love from your friends, or more love from yourself.  Of those three, only one is directly under your control – the love you have for yourself.  Generally speaking, being better with men won’t make your friends like you any better (and sometimes may have the opposite effect).  And chances are that if you are not happy with yourself right now, no amount of success with men will ever make up for that.  And no man will be able to trigger feelings of fulfillment in you.              In fact, it only gets harder when you have what you thought would make you happy and still find happiness elusive.  So go ahead and decide now to be comfortable in your own skin and to accept yourself exactly as you are.  Why?  Besides being a good starting point, there is no time when it’s not right now.  Now is the only time.  And true fulfillment can only come from sharing your joy, contentment and self-sufficiency with the rest of the world in the present moment.  Decide it, claim it, be it. Be content with what you have and who you areAnd you cannot be harmed.                            – Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching, Ch. 44              So if you’re perfectly okay right where you are, why would you need this book?  Great question.  It reminds me of an old Buddhist saying: “We are perfect as we are, and we could all use a little work.”  Here's one way to think about it.  Seeking out resources for self-improvement simply means that you are on a journey of growth.  And in order to reach your goals in dating – or anything else in life – it's important to believe that at every point along this journey of growth, you are complete.  A sequoia seedling is always a sequoia at every point along its path to becoming a towering tree.  And so are you always an empowered, fulfilled woman on your way to even greater empowerment and fulfillment.  You are always turning into the best possible version of you.               This is important because the world tends to be a reflection of your dominant thoughts.  When you signal to the world "I am okay," the world will agree with you.  When you signal “Well, I’ll be okay if I just get this little part fixed, but I’m not quite okay right now,” then the world will agree with you also.                Recognize that whatever mindset you have right now is the one you're likely to carry with you for the rest of your life.  If you don't think you're okay right now, chances are that no events or circumstances will change that.  Thus I encourage you to choose right now to adopt the mindset that, wherever you are, regardless of your real or imagined inadequacies, you accept yourself just as you are.  Stop the struggle and just be.  Chapter 29 of the Tao Te Ching puts it thus: Those who try to fix the world fail. The world is sacred; it can't be improved.Those who tamper with it harm it.Those who grasp at it lose it.There’s a time for leading,And a time for following;A time for blowing hot,And a time for blowing cold;A time for motionAnd a time for rest;A time for  vigor,And a time for exhaustion;A time for beginning,And a time for ending..The sage sees things as they are,And takes the middle path,Away from the extremes.

specifically geared for smart professional women. A guy, writing a dating book for women?As it turns out, my guy classmates were having similar issues, so I started out by writing the book for men, which I finished in three intense months of writing and research in 2005.  The book was well-received, and in late 2006, I set out to write the Tao of Dating for women, thinking that it would take about the same amount of time.  Piece of cake, right?  Wrong.  Turns out it’s not as easy as I thought to write a dating book for women when you’re not a woman.I was seriously stuck for a long time.  More than once I considered abandoning the project.  I mean, what does a guy know about the inner lives of women anyway?  Surely there were 3.5 billion people out there better-qualified to write this book[1].In the meantime, because of the success of the men’s book, I was getting daily letters from men about their dating woes.  And they were having said woes with women, shockingly enough.  Little by little, from these thousands of men, a database started to emerge: what they really liked, what they didn’t like so much, and what absolutely sent them running for the hills.  As their confidante, I also became privy to their innermost thoughts desires, and schemes.  Could this be of interest to my female readers?  Perhaps. Holly’s story, or how this book got finished              Then, something else happened.  Fast-forward to 2008.  The book is still slogging along, and I was visiting Boston, having relocated to Los Angeles in the interim.  I was having dinner with two of my college classmates, Ariela and Holly.  Both are professional women in their thirties, both charming, sweet, fabulous-looking and divorced.  Ariela is single without kids; Holly has a daughter and is seeing someone.  Let’s call him Tim.  Ariela clearly does not approve of Tim, so I decide to get the full story.              “Tell me about this guy,” I ask Holly.  She responds, “Well, he’s really tall and handsome; the sex is great; he’s really sweet most of the time; he’s a bit of the starving-artist type, and he’s not as successful as I am, so I’ve been supporting him for the past couple of years.”  So far, so bad.  I sensed she was holding back, and called her on it.  And – really sweet most of the time?  What’s up with that?“Well, when we first met he was just such a sweetheart.  But lately he’s been sniping at me, putting me down for no reason.  And when I spend time with my friends he gets really jealous and makes me feel guilty.”“Tell him what happened when your daughter fell down the stairs,” said Ariela with a fire of barely concealed rage in her eyes.Holly hesitated.  “Well, last month my daughter fell down the stairs at home and cut her head open.  There was blood everywhere, and we rushed her to the hospital.  I was so shaken, and I just needed Tim to be by my side, so I called him up.  He didn’t come.” Didn’t come?  Just like that?  And you’re still dating this deadbeat?“He said he was afraid of blood, and he just couldn’t deal with the situation.”My heart sank.  How was this possible?  Why was this amazing woman wasting another minute of her life on this unworthy man?  What else is happening that she’s not sharing with us?  How many other women like her were stuck in the same place?  At this point, Ariela and I made a very clear case for why Holly needed to break it off with this guy immediately.  Then Ariela looked me in the eye and held my right forearm for emphasis: “Ali, you have a duty to finish this book as quickly as possible.” I realized that if my book could help even one woman like Holly (and Monica) reclaim their power, then I had to complete it and bring it to light.  Two months after that talk, I finished The Tao of Dating.  And Holly asked Tim (who turns out was also physically abusing her) to move out and never contact her again, not a minute too soon. A dating guide for the modern smart, professional, educated woman              Although Monica and Holly were just two of the women amongst the dozens I spoke to, their cases were not unique.  Their stories all shared common themes.For most of the women there were external circumstances such as focus on their careers that accounted for part of what was happening.  But I was also hearing excuses from them that didn't make a lot of sense: "There aren't any good men."  "I don't have time to meet people."  "I'm an old-fashioned girl – dating's just not my thing."  Or the worst, from those who were dating the wrong guy: “But he’s nice sometimes.”  Some of them genuinely didn't know how to date effectively.  And they weren't entirely at fault: the rules of dating are unwritten, and no one had bothered to teach any of us what they might be.  But even more important, I witnessed that they had abdicated their own power as women and people.  While I saw them as tremendously attractive, magnetic individuals that any man would be lucky to associate with, they did not.  As a result, they ended up alone or with the wrong guy.              So this book has two objectives: to help educated, intelligent, discriminating women get back their personal power in the dating arena and beyond; and to give them some solid strategies for realizing a fulfilling dating life.  As a man, I wish to provide a fresh perspective on women's strength and beauty that they may have forgotten themselves and also provide the man's perspective on which dating strategies work best.              Since writing The Tao of Dating For Men three years ago, I have been privy to hundreds of stories of men's challenges relating to women.  I combined that with my own  experiences to give you a sense of what works best with educated, intelligent, successful men of integrity when it comes to dating.  As a hypnotherapist, seminar leader and personal success consultant, I want to give you tools to re-claim your personal power in all areas of your life.  If you’re reading this book, chances are you are a remarkable woman, and I want to make sure you remember that.  Think of this book as what a big brother with your best interest at heart would tell you if he had a thorough knowledge of the male psyche and had experienced several dates himself.  Seeing you happy makes me happy.              Some time ago, I was introduced to Taoist philosophy and found much wisdom in its lighthearted yet practical way of viewing the world.  As its title suggests, this book draws on Taoist philosophy, which arises from observation of the way the world works.  As such, it is more about the way things are, rather than the way things should be – more descriptive than prescriptive, more empirical than theoretical.  Like Taoism, there is no doctrine, no dogma, and few rules.  In fact, at every point, I encourage you to test the ideas and find out how well they work for you instead of blindly accepting them at face value.  If it works for you, keep it.  If it doesn't, toss it and try something else.                Like the teachings of the Eastern masters and the Tao Te Ching, the concepts may seem paradoxical at first.  I urge you to find the hidden truth behind the paradox.  You may also find that some of these ideas go directly against your expectations or beliefs.  In those cases, I encourage you to just test them out, without any prejudice as to whether they are right or wrong: just see what happens.  As Albert Einstein said, "If at first the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it."  Ordinary ideas and measures will give you ordinary results at best.  Extraordinary results, on the other hand, require extraordinary measures.  As such, the more an idea challenges your current belief set, the more likely it is to effect breakthrough in your life.              You should think of the ideas in this book as tools for achieving whatever your dating goals may be, from a fling to marriage.  I've based these concepts in ancient wisdom along with proven science to ensure that they are as timeless and universal as possible – as likely to be true a hundred years from now as they are today.  As such, although the book is based on a North American model of dating, most of the principles are applicable regardless of who or where you are.  At the same time, I make some assumptions about you, the reader: 1) You are interested in long-term fulfillment as opposed to short-term gain.  There are two operating words here: long-term and fulfillment.  As with investment and career choices, the tactics for short-term gain in dating tend to be different from the ones for long-term benefit.  Also, it's important to remember that fulfillment is not a person – it is a feeling.  And sometimes the way to have that fulfillment will seem paradoxical (e.g. spending some quality time alone).   2) For the purposes of long-term relationships, you are interested first and foremost in a Good Guy.  A Good Guy is a man (as opposed to a boy) who knows what he wants and knows where he's going.  He has a strong internal compass guiding him along his life's purpose, he's completely comfortable in his own skin, and he's a leader.  At the same time that he's a perfect gentleman, always having your well-being in mind, he's perfectly willing to give you some gentle ribbing every once in a while.  He exists in contradistinction to such male archetypes as the Bad Boy, Man-Child and Nice (But Kind of Wimpy) Guy. 3) You are open both to scientific concepts and spiritual principles and are willing to try on novel ideas that are likely to bring more fun and fulfillment into your life.  If you're more scientifically-oriented, consider this an introduction to spiritual concepts.  If you're more spiritually-oriented, consider this a chance to delve into your scientific side.               In the end, this book is more about helping you find your own way than about telling you what to do.  Sometimes we can get stuck in a rut, and all it takes is a tiny jolt, a little piece of information, to get us up and running again.  Many people are finding that jolt amongst the precepts of Eastern wisdom, and if you're reading this, it's likely that you are one of them.              Some of you will find The Tao of Dating highly applicable to where you are and where you want to be, and some perhaps less so.  As for me – I have been through 21 years of formal education, attended countless lectures and gone through thousands of books in my lifetime.  It’s safe to say that I have not used 100% of everything that I have learned.  But I still seek out new sources of information, sit through weekend-long seminars and sift through new books.  Even if I get one new idea, one mental shift to see something in a new way, one re-iteration of a key concept that I had forgotten, or one new application of a concept, then that exercise has been worthwhile.  I urge you to look at any new learning experience in that way, including this book.  New concepts sometimes take time to digest and results may be subtle at first, so go easy on yourself.              One spark is sometimes all it takes to start a raging fire, and I sincerely hope that you will find many sparks in the time you spend with this book.  I congratulate you on making the decision to bring the Tao into your life today.  Once you allow it, you will find that it will empower you and change your life in ways you had not imagined before.  The five themes of The Tao of Dating              This book is organized around five overarching themes.  We will go over each one in detail in the book, but I want to prime your mind so you pay closer attention each time they appear:   • The first is wealth-consciousness, or the mindset of abundance.  There is enough of everything to go around for everyone.   • The second is the Be-Do-Have mentality, which relates to Napoleon Hill’s famous saying from Think and Grow Rich: “Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.”   • The third is enlightened self-interest, which is about acting with your long-term well-being in mind.    • The fourth is feminine-masculine (yin-yang) polarity. • The fifth is getting out of your own way. How to use this book              The purpose of The Tao of Dating is not just to give you some tricks and hints for you to scrape by on, but rather to turn you into the most empowered, fulfilled version of you possible.  As such, this book is equally about transformation and information.  In order to effect that transformation, you have to apply the principles in the book to your life.                So I want you to approach this book less as a novel that you read once and shelve and more like a handbook, travel guide or cookbook.  Mark up the chapters and exercises that you like and come back to them.  I've read the Tao Te Ching at least 300 times, and I keep on coming back to it, just because something in there always provides me with a new perspective on what's happening.  Think of this book in that vein – a reference you will keep on coming back to.                Now if you’re like most people, you are probably going to start reading the book, get to an exercise, skip it, and go straight to the juicy parts about tips and tricks.  So go ahead and do that – I won't tell anyone.  Skim the book once from beginning to end.  Then go back and do the exercises.  That is where the transformation occurs (and where some of the tips and tricks are hidden).                The Tao of Dating contains a lot of information.  If you attempt to remember and try out every idea at once, it may be overwhelming.  That is why the book is organized in a linear fashion.  Start from the beginning, from the work on values, beliefs, attitudes and what you want.  Then move on to the section on how to find quality men.  Progress stepwise to meeting men, attracting them, and perpetuating your relationships with them.                Think of it as baking bread.  If you’ve never done it before, you start by thinking about a recipe.  You then go through each step of making the bread in order: go to store, buy ingredients, mix them, make dough, bake, eat.  If you try to do everything at once, you’re more likely to end up with a mess in the kitchen than an edible loaf.  But if you proceed sequentially, at every step of the way you just have to remember what the next step is.  As Lao Tzu says, “The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.”  Go easy, and good fortune.                I’m very interested in your thoughts about this book, so do me a favor and drop a line sometime.  Just put 'Question', or 'Comment' or 'That was awesome can I buy you a drink'  in the subject line of your email so I know to pay special attention to it.

Amazon neurosis, "the woman who achieves at the expense of her tender places."                There is another way, of course.  If you wish to be cherished, celebrated and incredibly attractive to men, you may wish to relinquish some of the yang when you're at home and embrace the full power of the feminine.  As Williamson put it, "In intimate relationships with men, I want to major in feminine and minor in masculine." Yin and yang in a relationship              I have noticed that many women in relationships feel that it is their job to steer its course and provide most of the fuel to propel it.  She will be the one to initiate serious talks about where the relationship is headed and to give of her time and energy to keep the relationship going.  However, from a yin-yang perspective, leading and giving are masculine functions.  Even though there is a tendency to think that giving is a feminine function, at its essence it’s a masculine one.  The feminine is the receptive.                Of course, in any true partnership, both parties are engaged in giving and taking, which in its highest form manifests as sharing.  However, it's important to keep in mind that if you take over the masculine function of giving, then it leaves no room for the man to do that.                Therefore one way to think about relationships is in terms of depth and direction.  The depth is a function of yin; the direction is a function of yang.  And so, roughly speaking, the masculine will be in charge of the direction of the relationship, while the feminine will be responsible for its depth.              Although we will talk more about what to do once you are in a relationship, keep in mind that this book is mostly about dating, not relationships.  Once you've successfully navigated the waters of dating to arrive at a relationship, you may wish to seek out some of the resources featured at the end of the book (e.g. the works of  professor of psychology John Gottman).

Chapter 4. What You Really Want                What do you want from your dating life?  Most people don’t have a concrete answer to this question.  And the people who think they know what they want sometimes end up getting it, only to realize it’s not quite what they expected (affective forecasting again).               As we discussed early in the book, what we want from a relationship (and almost everything else in life) are fulfilling feelings.  Once you think of it that way, you realize that you’re not looking for a particular kind of person, of a certain height or hair color or socioeconomic status, but rather the feelings that person evokes in you.                You also realize that fulfillment is more of an internal phenomenon than an external one, depending on yourself more than anything.  It’s not about what your parents or friends think.  It’s not about how strangers look at the two of you together.  It’s about how your values are fulfilled on the inside.                 At any point in life, what you think you want may vary.  And often what we think we want doesn’t really fulfill us when we get it.  As stated earlier, we’re quite bad at affective forecasting, always overestimating how much things will make us happy (or unhappy) in the long term.  However, your values tend to remain constant.  That’s because values are deep, unconscious motivators that give the general sense of purpose and direction to your life.  Although values are the strongest drivers of our overall behavior, we often don’t know about them until they are violated, much like how we notice the stomach only when we have a stomach ache.                There are two more ways of figuring out what your values are besides having them violated.  One is by noticing events that fulfill them, and the other is through conscious inner exploration.  The next exercise will get you started on that exploration.  For further resources on figuring out your values, I recommend the book NLP: The New Technology of Achievement, which has a series of drills in the chapter entitled ‘Discovering Your Mission,’ from which the following list of values was adapted. Exercise 5. Empower yourself by figuring out your core valuesWhat are your values in life?  From the list below, pick ten values that you feel are most important to you.  If there’s a value that is important to you that you do not see on the list, add it on.                Write down your ten values.  Now, if you could have one and only one of these, which one would it be?  Mark it “1.”  Now, from the remaining nine values, if you could have one and just one, which one would it be?  Mark it “2.”  Continue this process until you have your top 5 values.      autonomy   beauty   courage   creativity   excellence   excitement   fulfillment   fun   abundance   power   family   humility   harmony   helping   innovation   joy   love   mastery   playfulness   revolution   self-actualization   self-reliance   problem-solving   creating change   uniqueness   vitality   caring   challenge   dignity   elegance   fairness   freedom   grace   happiness   kindness   respect   education   bliss   honesty   humor    justice   learning   order   perseverance   safety   security   service   simplicity   synergy   truth    wisdom   zest               Let’s revisit the question from the beginning of the chapter.  What do you want from your dating life?  The answer is you want from your dating life the same things you want from your life in general.  Values affect all areas of your life, so your overall values for life tend to be the same ones as your values for relationships.  Once you know what your values are, you can decide how you’d like to fulfill them.                It’s best to fulfill your values in a way that creates the least amount of conflict amongst your top values.  Let’s say one of your values is adventure.  You can experience that in the context of having one adventure with several men, or several adventures with one man.  If another one of your values is variety, then you will probably choose the former option.  If one of your values is stability, then perhaps you will choose the latter option.                You now have an internal compass for knowing when a given relationship is aligned with your values.  If your values are being matched, the relationship will naturally flourish.  If not, the relationship will falter and you will want to move on. What you have to offer              Would you date yourself?  I'm not asking a frivolous question.  For a moment, take the perspective of a man who is actually interested in you.  Perhaps you have even been on a couple of dates together.  Now, ask yourself these questions: “What draws me to this woman?  Why do I want to see her again?”  Take a look at the inventory of values that you came up with in the previous exercise (and if you didn’t do the exercise, go back and do it – the rest of the book hinges upon that information).  How many of those would you be able to fulfill in a relationship with a man?   Exercise 6. Walking the walkDetermine how many of the values you came up with in Exercise 5 are ones you can actually provide in a relationship.               It’s very important to be honest with yourself in this exercise.  No one is looking over your shoulder, and all of this information is for your benefit alone, so it is to your great advantage to provide the most accurate information possible.Now look at that list of values again.  If you feel that you can provide many of those values in a relationship, great.  You need not possess all of them, since yin-yang dynamics is about complementarity, too.  For example, you can appreciate humor in your man without being a stand-up comic yourself.  But if you’re missing most of the values that you demand in a partner, perhaps you have some work to do in those departments.                For example, let’s say spontaneity and honesty are two values that you cherish in a relationship, yet you tend to shy away from new activities, or be very secretive about your thoughts and feelings.  Since this is clearly not compatible with your stated values of spontaneity and honesty, you must either change your behavior to become consistent with your values, or change your values to become consistent with your behavior.  To demand certain standards from your partners, it’s a good idea to meet them yourself first. Exercise 7. Take stock of your relationship assetsWrite down everything about you that is interesting and attractive.  What reasons would a man have to see you again, or to stay with you in a relationship?               This exercise is an assessment of what you offer in a  relationship.  Are you funny?  Exceptionally generous and kind?  A great cook?  Do you provide witty conversation?  Can you stimulate his mind?  His body?  Do you have exceptional sexual expertise?  Do you have an infectious sense of adventure and wonder?  Write down every reason that a man would want to spend time with you, from the most trivial to the most important.  Having done that, let’s take a brutally honest look at this list to find out which of the items would actually matter to a man.  For example, you may have exceptionally good taste in upholstery, or have shoes to fit any and every occasion.  But will he necessarily care about that?  You want to assess what he (not your girlfriends) will see as an asset.                But how do you make this assessment?  What do men really want?  The broad answer to that is that men (and women) seek things that makes them feel good.  Your mastery of the subtleties of women's shoes is probably not one of those things.  Your massage skill, on the other hand, is a much better bet.   Yin, yang and three stages of relationship              As we discussed in Chapter 3, the principle of polarity governs attraction in the universe. Positive charge is attracted to negative charge, whereas like charges repel one another.  The north pole of a magnet attracts the south pole.  And so it is with masculine and feminine.  For there to be a spark, a flow of energy between two entities, there needs to be polarity.  This seems to be particularly true in relationships between men and women.                And so masculine and feminine are two manifestations of the universal life principle.  Everyone possesses elements of both masculine and feminine energy.  Men tend to have more masculine energy, or yang according to Taoist tradition, and women tend to have more feminine energy, or yin.  What's important to remember is that for there to be a flow of energy and vitality within a relationship, there needs to be polarity, regardless of which party has more masculine or feminine energy.                Let's examine this in the context of male-female relationships.  I find David Deida’s simple but powerful way of describing relationships through three stages useful as a general framework.              The first stage relationship is between a macho jerk and a dependent, submissive woman.  The man is strong but not terribly considerate and carries a lot of masculine energy.  He has a lot of spine, but no heart.  The woman, on the other hand, will do anything to get even a little bit of love.  She has a lot of feminine energy.  She has a lot of heart, but not much spine.  Sure, there is plenty of polarity in this relationship, but there's much left to be desired. We call this the codependence stage, and room for growth within this kind of relationship is limited at best.                The second stage relationship is between the sensitive man and the independent woman.  This is a man who realizes that women want a guy who listens, who is in touch with his feelings, who has an open heart.  So he has taken it upon himself to bring more feminine yin energy into his life.  The woman in this kind of relationship is strong and independent.  Typically, she has a job with a lot of responsibility.  She can take care of herself financially and doesn't really need a man.  As such, she has brought a fair amount of masculine yang energy on board.                This is the independence stage.  Although this kind of relationship is a progression from the first, much of the polarity is lost in the feminizing of the man and the masculinizing of the woman.  Such relationships tend to fall flat after a while, and may very well be part of the reason behind the high divorce rates nowadays.  The man in this kind of relationship has a lot more heart than the first-stage fellow; however, in the process, he has lost much of his spine.                The third stage relationship is between the man as a spiritual warrior and the woman as a fully-realized goddess.  Here, the man is able and willing to take the woman deeper into her feminine essence than she could by herself.  And the woman, in turn, is able to guide the man deeper into his life's purpose than he could by himself.  I call this the stage of mutual flourishing.  The man in this kind of relationship has both heart and spine, both compassion and unwavering purpose.  He is the combination of the best elements of the man from the Stage 1 and Stage 2 relationships.  Notice also that in this stage, compared to Stage 1, both the man and the woman are adept at taking on the complementary energy (yin for men, yang for women) while the guy majors in masculine and the girl majors in feminine.            Man    Woman   Stage 1: Co-dependent   all spine, no heart   no spine, all heart   Stage 2: Independent   less spine, more heart   more spine, less heart   Stage 3: Mutual Flourishing   both spine and heart   both spine and heart The kind of guy you would want              Now that we've discussed the types of relationships that are possible with a man, it's easier to create a picture of the kind of man who would fit in that picture.  As we said before, you're much more likely to find something if you have a good idea of what you're looking for.  Throughout this book, we're going to talk about a prototype of a man with whom you're most likely to have a fulfilling relationship.  He's the fellow from the Third Stage relationship we described above – the spiritual warrior, the man with both compassion and purpose, heart and spine.  For short, henceforth I will call him the Good Guy, and we shall spend some time describing him in detail during the course of this book – things that will aid you in spotting him and inviting him into your life.                Now as you are sitting somewhere and reading this book, my dear reader, I don't really know you that well.  However, I assume that if you’ve taken it upon yourself to pick up this book, you are interested in a fulfilling relationship.  Fulfillment comes in many shapes and sizes, and the Tao of Dating is about giving you the tools to find that fulfillment, regardless of your starting point.  Roughly speaking, we'll categorize relationships into three categories by duration – short, medium and long-term – and see how each guy fits in.  Regardless of what constitutes your fulfillment, it helps if you enter into each kind of relationship consciously, knowing roughly what to expect.  Short-term relationships (also known as 'flings'). This is the kind of relationship you enter without expecting it to last long.  It could be anything from an evening's encounter to a one-week vacation romance to a summer-long fling.  The distinction here is your mindset: you are entering this relationship with few expectations as to long-term potential.                For this kind of relationship, any of the three kinds of men will probably do. However, there are ramifications.  The first-stage guy, masculine but not very heart-centered, is the one you're most likely to have fun with while managing a clean break at the end.  We'll call him Biff.  The second-stage guy – the sensitive guy, whom we will dub Lance – is the one most likely to be hurt at the end.  He'll probably try to keep in touch, calling and writing to tell you how much he misses you and how much you mean to him.  This could be sweet but annoying at the same time.  The third-stage guy – both strong and compassionate, whom we will call Victor – can handle whatever happens just fine.  However, you will be more likely to be hurt at the end, realizing how much he meant to you and wanting more from him than he may be able to offer.   Medium-term relationships (also known as 'serious relationship' or 'boyfriend').  There comes a time when you want to be with a man for the long term, but not necessarily forever.  You're ready for a lease, but maybe not a full purchase – a boyfriend, but not a husband.  You're not necessarily entering the relationship thinking, "Well, this is going to last a few months and then I'll be moving along," but in effect that's what it is.                Starting with this kind of relationship, it's best to toss out the Stage 1 guy completely.  Biff is at best a dessert, enjoyed sparingly; he is never a main course.  If you substitute dessert for real, nutritious food on a regular basis, you will be unhappy and unhealthy, which is precisely the effect of having a Biff in your life long-term.                The Stage 2 guy – Lance – is fine for this kind of relationship.  You have (and will have) many joyous, fulfilling relationships with Lance.  Just be aware that the full flourishing of you will probably not occur with a Lance, and so turning him into a marriage prospect, as sensible as it may seem at the moment, is likely to be a formula for long-term disappointment.  And we're all about enlightened self-interest here, which has your long-term fulfillment in mind.  He just may not be ready for you – ever.              Finally, there's Victor, the Stage 3 guy.  He would be great for this kind of relationship (or any kind, really).  The only issue is that if you're not on the market for marriage, you may not be ready for him.  Reverse disappointment is still disappointment, and teasing yourself with this amazing guy with whom you can't stay (for whatever reason) is something to consider. Long-term relationships (also known as 'marriage' or 'life partnership').  For this kind of relationship, I can only recommend the Stage 3 man.  You are long done with Biff, you can handle Lance fine but he can't handle you, and now you're ready for the real thing.  Although there are probably more Lances and Biffs than Victors, there are are still plenty of Victors out there, so keep an eye out for them.  The good news is that many Lances have the capacity to turn into Victors, especially when they are in relationship with a fully-realized goddess (that would be you).  If anything has the power to transform, it is love, so take heart.

### ✨ Most of the techniques in this book will work regardless of your intention vis-à-vis the men you meet – anywhere from “I want to meet the man I can cherish for the rest of my life” to “I want to have a one-night stand.”  However, The Tao of Dating will work most effectively when you have a strong positive intention which incorporates the beliefs we discussed in Chapter 4, the most important of which being "the world is a reflection of me."


Fulfillment is a feeling, not a person              The most common question I get from my readers is "How do I get this guy?"  The answer is simple: you're asking the wrong question.                Deep down, women seek relationships not because they want a particular guy, but rather because they want the feelings that a good relationship brings them.  This class of feelings I call fulfillment.  Fulfillment is having someone to see that movie with, someone to cook dinner for (or to cook for you), someone to take with you to your best friend's wedding, someone to cuddle up with on a Friday night.              A big mistake in relationships is focusing on the person instead of the fulfillment.  The object of your desire could be the most exceptional man on earth, but if he lives 5 hours away or is a workaholic and is never around when you want his company, chances are you are not going to be fulfilled in the long run.                When you are dating someone, ask yourself often, "Do I feel fulfilled in this relationship?" and answer that question with utter honesty.  If the answer is 'no' at any point, you may wish to reconsider your situation.  The flip side of that is when you do feel fulfilled for the most part, but there are some points of conflict looming in your mind.  In that case, you may wish to weigh the relative importance of those peccadilloes compared to the fulfillment you're already experiencing.               Another issue with seeking out a particular man as the key to your fulfillment is that by doing so, you are denying the abundance of the world.  When you chase anything in life, you are affirming its lack in your life.  Spiritual law holds that the world tends to mirror your dominant thoughts.  So if you affirm the lack of something in your life, be it wealth, companionship or health, the world will agree with you, and that thing will be driven farther away from your reach.  We'll discuss this topic further in Chapter 5 on Beliefs.              Now one sure way to chase away your own fulfillment is to compare yourself to others:  Jane has a better-looking, better-educated boyfriend who cooks for her; Barbara's boyfriend is marriage-minded, etc.  Comparison gets you in trouble because comparing yourself with those whom you perceive as better off can make you bitter.  Comparison with those whom you perceive as worse off can make you vain (and frankly, bitter and vain people are a bit of a drag to be around).  If you’re ever going to compare, compare yourself to your former self, and notice how far you have come along.  And stay centered on your fulfillment, which will be different from that of anyone else. The power of gratitude              So what constitutes a more effective approach than wishing, wanting, needing, and yearning your way into a fulfilling relationship?  The secret weapon here is called gratitude.  The idea is simple: right now, if you are sitting somewhere and reading this book, chances are you have a roof over your head and are clothed and fed.  You probably have a job and friends and family who care for you.  Trillions of cellular operations are all working in harmony this very second to keep you alive and functioning.  There is no end to the things you could be grateful for.                Of course, you have a choice.  You could focus on what's missing from your life – a 70-ft yacht on the French Riviera, a villa in Tuscany or a doting, movie-star boyfriend or husband.  Or you can focus on the infinitude of things that are right with your life (and there are billions of them, I assure you).  Focusing on the billions of things that are right with your life is more likely to make you feel good than focusing on the few things that you perceive as missing.  Try this fun little exercise to get a better sense of what I mean. Exercise 1. The Power of FocusTake about 30 seconds right now to look around the room.  Take notice and mentally catalog everything in the room that is brown, and do your best to remember as many of them as possible.  Look around and do that now; when you are done, continue reading.                 Now, while keeping your eye on the page, recall all the items in the room that are green.  Green?  Yes, green.  You probably didn’t come up with many, since you were so focused on the brown stuff.  You tend to get more of what you focus on.  So choose to focus on the good stuff, and you’ll have no choice but to get more of it.               Gratitude feels good.  Gratitude may be the most empowering feeling you can have.  And it's always there, even when you think it isn't.  All you have to do is to choose to focus on what's good in your life.  In his moving book Man's Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl recounts how even in the midst of the unimaginable brutality of a Nazi concentration camp, he was able to find things to be grateful for: the companionship of his friends in camp; a moment of solitude; the savoring of a dry morsel of bread.  So when you’re feeling down, it can be helpful to remind yourself of how good you really do have it compared to what could be.              You can even feel gratitude for the relationship that you would like to have.  The fact is that the person with whom you'll be sharing this relationship is already out there somewhere, and it's only a matter of time before you meet or recognize him.  Think of it as a paycheck that you've already worked for and is coming to you sooner or later; you're sure it's coming, just not exactly when it's coming.  And you're okay with that.                When you feel gratitude, you feel good, and when you feel good, you glow.  Other people will gravitate towards you.  There is no more attractive force than being an epicenter of positive feeling.  So gratitude becomes the magnet that will draw the right person into your life.  As Tenzin Gyatso, the 13th Dalai Lama famously noted, "There is no way to happiness; happiness is the way."              Another neat feature of gratitude is that it tends to be its own reward.  Feelings don't come with little color-coded flags saying this is the name of what you are feeling.  For example, what you may think of as fear you could just as easily re-interpret as excitement or anticipation.  Similarly, gratitude feels a lot like fulfillment; in fact, it may be the essence of what fulfillment is.  So when you consciously choose to feel gratitude, you're bringing fulfillment into your life on demand.  And when you have that feeling of fulfillment and the empowerment that comes with it, you may no longer feel that you really need a man, since you already have the feelings that he would bring.  However, you may still want a man, which is a much more empowered position to operate from than needing one.  More on that later. The Be-Do-Have Paradigm              Most people are seeking some kind of result in life, and believe that success means having that result, be it wealth, status, relationships.  As such, they’re often looking for the shortcut, the quick and dirty solution, the overnight scheme.  Sure, there are overnight schemes; the problem is that they also tend to last only overnight.  Easy come, easy go.                True success, on the other hand, is not an accident; it is a habit.  Most lottery winners go back to their original or lower level of wealth just two years after winning all that money; many go bankrupt.  True success only comes from embarking on a path of mastery, which takes time and effort.  By purchasing this book and reading this far, you have taken the first and second steps on that path.  For that I congratulate you.  Seventy percent of people don’t even make it this far[*].  Keep up the good work.              Most people think of success in terms of possession: in order to be someone, you must have something.  If you have money and spend lots of it, you are rich.  If you have an attractive mate, you are successful in dating.                The truth is that the reverse of this mindset is the true key to success.  All great works of spirituality from the Tao Te Ching to the Bible emphasize that the first step of success is to embody the vision of the success you want to have: "As you believe, so it is done unto you."  A simple and powerful articulation of this is the Be-Do-Have paradigm, in which success comes from possessing the mindset, “I am a successful person.”  This in turn leads to actions.  The actions then manifest the signs that people commonly refer to as success.                There is a long-standing tradition in Eastern wisdom of being detached from results.  As Krishna said to Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita, you are entitled to your actions, not the results of your actions.  Here’s the insight: if you are following the path of fulfillment, then the action is the result.  The work is the wealth.  As Mahatma Gandhi put it, “Full effort is full victory.”                    Let’s use the example of money.  In order to be wealthy, first you must be a wealthy person, with the attendant mindsets and beliefs.  You wake up in the morning thinking, “How would Warren Buffett spend his day?”  Once you have convinced your brain that you are a wealthy person, then you will naturally do what a wealthy person does – do your homework, make good decisions, have shrewd associates, be thrifty in your ways, have overall welfare in mind.  And, as a result, not only will you  effortlessly have what a wealthy person possesses, but you will also have the true wealth of following a path of fulfillment.  This is true of any sphere of endeavor.   You rise to a higher level of consciousness by taking your attention away from your present limitations and placing it upon that which you desire to be.  Do not attempt this in day-dreaming or wishful thinking but in a positive manner.  Claim yourself to be the thing desired.  I AM that; no sacrifice, no diet, no human tricks.  All that is asked of you is to accept your desire.  If you dare claim it, you will express it.                – Neville, Your Faith Is Your Fortune               For example, Marie Curie was always the brilliant Nobel-winning scientist, even when she was a young, penniless nanny.  When she inhabited that 18-year old mind and body without access to knowledge of her future, she may have never imagined turning into one of the greatest scientists in history and the winner of two Nobel prizes.  Yet to us, it seems strange to think of her any other way than the Marie Curie, regardless of her age.  You can apply that example to the young versions of any great person in history.  The young Eleanor Roosevelt, Jane Austen, and Indira Gandhi all harbored self-doubt in their development towards greatness.  Yet, in retrospect, they were great to us even as young women on the journey.  Recognize that you are on that same journey of greatness, and that it takes a little bit of time for the greatness to fully manifest.              So now I invite you to envision the most brilliant vision of your future.  Where do you see yourself in 10 years?  In twenty?  What will you accomplish?  How do you want to be remembered?  What kind of relationships will you have?  With what kind of people?  Make that vision as grand as possible, and then start to embody it immediately.  Re-read the quote from Neville above.  Is there a guarantee that all the details of your vision will come true?  Perhaps not 100%.  But without the vision, there is hardly a chance of achieving the goal.                So dare to think and imagine.  No one has access to your thoughts, so make them as big and brilliant and inspiring as possible.  Great thoughts cost as much as mediocre ones, so might as well go big.  Now is a good time to do the following exercise. Exercise 2. Your highest vision of yourselfTake a deep breath and close your eyes.  Imagine yourself as a child, maybe 7 years old.  Remember then how badly you wanted to grow up, be tall, go places like the grownups, reach high shelves, drive a car.  Remember that feeling of inadequacy that you had then and how you just couldn’t wait for all this to happen.                Now bring a picture of your current adult self into the scene, and give your child self a big hug saying, “Hey, told you it was all going to be all right.”  Feel that deep compassion and acceptance.                Now imagine a third version of yourself – a version from the future that embodies all the accomplishments and goals you are seeking right now.  What does that person look like?  Really take the time to notice her voice, her gait, her demeanor.  How does she look and sound?  How does it feel to be her?  Now have that future you come in and give the present you a big hug, saying “It’s all going to be all right,” just the way you hugged the 7-year old you.                Now let the three pictures of you from the past, present and the future merge into one another, leaving an image of that highest vision of yourself, and realize that it is you, right now.  When you feel the empowering feelings that brings, squeeze your left fist twice.  From now on, all you have to do to bring that empowering feeling back is to repeat that double squeeze.                  In this chapter, we will break down the Be-Do-Have paradigm into four practical components: right beliefs, leading to right attitudes, leading to right behaviors, which naturally flow into right results.  The steps go from the more hidden to the more manifest.  Beliefs and attitudes are the be phase; attitudes and behaviors are the do phase; results are the have phase.                Beliefs are completely hidden, not even manifest to the trained eye.  Since your beliefs are yours to know alone, it makes sense to have the most effective beliefs possible, as grandiose or foolhardy as they may sound.  Strong, empowering beliefs cost as much as mediocre, ineffective ones: they’re all free![2]  So use the beliefs that serve you best.              An attitude is the first-level manifestation of a belief, hardly detectable even to a trained observer.  Sometimes it is expressed verbally or in body language; other times it manifests itself as the subtext of behavior.  People tend to respond not to your hidden thoughts or to your manifest behavior, but rather to your overall attitude.  Your attitude is the meta-message and meaning of your behavior.              Behavior is what you do, which is easy to observe.  The range of possible behaviors is infinite, yet most of us operate within a narrow envelope of behavior which those who know us call our personality.  When we do something that seems to breach that narrow envelope, they say that we are behaving ‘out of character.’  Behavioral range is determined by attitudes and beliefs.  It is possible to change attitudes and beliefs by regularly engaging in new behaviors consistent with those new beliefs.                 Results are the most manifest component of the process.  Results broadcast themselves just fine yet reveal little useful information regarding how to achieve them.  Knowing how much wealth someone has does not help you get rich like them; nor does seeing that someone has a wonderful companion tell you how that came about.  This may seem obvious, but most people find themselves motivated by observing the results and not the process by which they came into being.  So henceforth, in all spheres of life, wherever you observe success, look at the process.  That is where the true wealth resides.                 The soft overcomes the hard.              Flexibility overcomes force.              Keep your inner workings to yourself.              Let your results speak for themselves.                                          – Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching, Ch. 36 Affective forecasting, or what really happens when you get what you want              We humans are hypersocial beings, and companionship is an essential part of our experience.  But, come to think of it, you don't really need a man in your life.  Not the same way you need food, water, shelter, clothing, oxygen and Vitamin D; they are essential to your survival and health.  Now you may want a man, and that's okay (and in any case, men are much more flattered when they are wanted rather than needed).               However, a man is not a panacea.  If you're in a bad job situation, don't get along with your family, have financial troubles, or fundamentally aren't happy with yourself, a man in your life is not likely to solve those issues, no matter how fantastic he is.  A man can at best be a conduit and catalyst for feelings of fulfillment.  Keep in mind especially that all feelings that you have, you generate inside your head.  There is no wire from the outside world that plugs into the back of your head and makes you have feelings.  If there is one person in the world chiefly responsible for your feelings, it's you.                Daniel Gilbert of Harvard studies affective forecasting, our ability to predict how we will feel in the future in response to events.  What he has found is that, a few months down the road from the event, we don’t feel nearly as good as we thought we would about pleasant things, nor feel nearly as bad about negative ones.  In other words, we overestimate both our happiness and distress in response to future events.  A year after an event, we tend to return to the same baseline level of happiness we had before.                Finding a suitable male companion may be likened to winning the lottery.  Most women desirous of a relationship think they would be really happy if they started dating a wonderful man, in the same way that most people think they'd be really happy if they won a lottery.  The fact is, soon after winning a lottery, the winners tend to return to the baseline level of happiness they had before winning.  It's reasonable to conclude that the level of contentment and happiness you feel, after the initial whirlwind of excitement in a relationship has settled, is the same as the one you are experiencing right now in your seat while reading this passage.                There is a spiritual principle in operation here, reiterated in many guises in numerous traditions, but its essence is this: You have everything that you need. Right here, right now.  Now this may be challenging to grasp, as you wonder about unpaid bills, an empty fridge and all that extra room in your bed at night.  But at a deep and fundamental level, it is always true. At every point in your life leading to this moment, you have had everything that you needed (once gain, emphasizing need rather than want): a womb in which the cells of your body multiplied and grew, caregivers to raise you, a nervous system that was capable of learning language, movement and other complex tasks, and the inner resources to succeed at school, work and human relations.                However, let's leave alone the factual accuracy of whether or not you have everything that you need and play pretend for a moment: What if that were actually true?  How would that make you feel?  What kind of person would you be if you truly believed that you have everything that you need?  And what kind of people would you draw into your life if you were that person?  Start there.  In the chapter on beliefs, we will delve deeper into how beliefs empower you and bring you more of what you want.

Chapter 4. What You Really Want                What do you want from your dating life?  Most people don’t have a concrete answer to this question.  And the people who think they know what they want sometimes end up getting it, only to realize it’s not quite what they expected (affective forecasting again).               As we discussed early in the book, what we want from a relationship (and almost everything else in life) are fulfilling feelings.  Once you think of it that way, you realize that you’re not looking for a particular kind of person, of a certain height or hair color or socioeconomic status, but rather the feelings that person evokes in you.                You also realize that fulfillment is more of an internal phenomenon than an external one, depending on yourself more than anything.  It’s not about what your parents or friends think.  It’s not about how strangers look at the two of you together.  It’s about how your values are fulfilled on the inside.                 At any point in life, what you think you want may vary.  And often what we think we want doesn’t really fulfill us when we get it.  As stated earlier, we’re quite bad at affective forecasting, always overestimating how much things will make us happy (or unhappy) in the long term.  However, your values tend to remain constant.  That’s because values are deep, unconscious motivators that give the general sense of purpose and direction to your life.  Although values are the strongest drivers of our overall behavior, we often don’t know about them until they are violated, much like how we notice the stomach only when we have a stomach ache.                There are two more ways of figuring out what your values are besides having them violated.  One is by noticing events that fulfill them, and the other is through conscious inner exploration.  The next exercise will get you started on that exploration.  For further resources on figuring out your values, I recommend the book NLP: The New Technology of Achievement, which has a series of drills in the chapter entitled ‘Discovering Your Mission,’ from which the following list of values was adapted. Exercise 5. Empower yourself by figuring out your core valuesWhat are your values in life?  From the list below, pick ten values that you feel are most important to you.  If there’s a value that is important to you that you do not see on the list, add it on.                Write down your ten values.  Now, if you could have one and only one of these, which one would it be?  Mark it “1.”  Now, from the remaining nine values, if you could have one and just one, which one would it be?  Mark it “2.”  Continue this process until you have your top 5 values.      autonomy   beauty   courage   creativity   excellence   excitement   fulfillment   fun   abundance   power   family   humility   harmony   helping   innovation   joy   love   mastery   playfulness   revolution   self-actualization   self-reliance   problem-solving   creating change   uniqueness   vitality   caring   challenge   dignity   elegance   fairness   freedom   grace   happiness   kindness   respect   education   bliss   honesty   humor    justice   learning   order   perseverance   safety   security   service   simplicity   synergy   truth    wisdom   zest               Let’s revisit the question from the beginning of the chapter.  What do you want from your dating life?  The answer is you want from your dating life the same things you want from your life in general.  Values affect all areas of your life, so your overall values for life tend to be the same ones as your values for relationships.  Once you know what your values are, you can decide how you’d like to fulfill them.                It’s best to fulfill your values in a way that creates the least amount of conflict amongst your top values.  Let’s say one of your values is adventure.  You can experience that in the context of having one adventure with several men, or several adventures with one man.  If another one of your values is variety, then you will probably choose the former option.  If one of your values is stability, then perhaps you will choose the latter option.                You now have an internal compass for knowing when a given relationship is aligned with your values.  If your values are being matched, the relationship will naturally flourish.  If not, the relationship will falter and you will want to move on. What you have to offer              Would you date yourself?  I'm not asking a frivolous question.  For a moment, take the perspective of a man who is actually interested in you.  Perhaps you have even been on a couple of dates together.  Now, ask yourself these questions: “What draws me to this woman?  Why do I want to see her again?”  Take a look at the inventory of values that you came up with in the previous exercise (and if you didn’t do the exercise, go back and do it – the rest of the book hinges upon that information).  How many of those would you be able to fulfill in a relationship with a man?   Exercise 6. Walking the walkDetermine how many of the values you came up with in Exercise 5 are ones you can actually provide in a relationship.               It’s very important to be honest with yourself in this exercise.  No one is looking over your shoulder, and all of this information is for your benefit alone, so it is to your great advantage to provide the most accurate information possible.Now look at that list of values again.  If you feel that you can provide many of those values in a relationship, great.  You need not possess all of them, since yin-yang dynamics is about complementarity, too.  For example, you can appreciate humor in your man without being a stand-up comic yourself.  But if you’re missing most of the values that you demand in a partner, perhaps you have some work to do in those departments.                For example, let’s say spontaneity and honesty are two values that you cherish in a relationship, yet you tend to shy away from new activities, or be very secretive about your thoughts and feelings.  Since this is clearly not compatible with your stated values of spontaneity and honesty, you must either change your behavior to become consistent with your values, or change your values to become consistent with your behavior.  To demand certain standards from your partners, it’s a good idea to meet them yourself first. Exercise 7. Take stock of your relationship assetsWrite down everything about you that is interesting and attractive.  What reasons would a man have to see you again, or to stay with you in a relationship?               This exercise is an assessment of what you offer in a  relationship.  Are you funny?  Exceptionally generous and kind?  A great cook?  Do you provide witty conversation?  Can you stimulate his mind?  His body?  Do you have exceptional sexual expertise?  Do you have an infectious sense of adventure and wonder?  Write down every reason that a man would want to spend time with you, from the most trivial to the most important.  Having done that, let’s take a brutally honest look at this list to find out which of the items would actually matter to a man.  For example, you may have exceptionally good taste in upholstery, or have shoes to fit any and every occasion.  But will he necessarily care about that?  You want to assess what he (not your girlfriends) will see as an asset.                But how do you make this assessment?  What do men really want?  The broad answer to that is that men (and women) seek things that makes them feel good.  Your mastery of the subtleties of women's shoes is probably not one of those things.  Your massage skill, on the other hand, is a much better bet.   Yin, yang and three stages of relationship              As we discussed in Chapter 3, the principle of polarity governs attraction in the universe. Positive charge is attracted to negative charge, whereas like charges repel one another.  The north pole of a magnet attracts the south pole.  And so it is with masculine and feminine.  For there to be a spark, a flow of energy between two entities, there needs to be polarity.  This seems to be particularly true in relationships between men and women.                And so masculine and feminine are two manifestations of the universal life principle.  Everyone possesses elements of both masculine and feminine energy.  Men tend to have more masculine energy, or yang according to Taoist tradition, and women tend to have more feminine energy, or yin.  What's important to remember is that for there to be a flow of energy and vitality within a relationship, there needs to be polarity, regardless of which party has more masculine or feminine energy.                Let's examine this in the context of male-female relationships.  I find David Deida’s simple but powerful way of describing relationships through three stages useful as a general framework.              The first stage relationship is between a macho jerk and a dependent, submissive woman.  The man is strong but not terribly considerate and carries a lot of masculine energy.  He has a lot of spine, but no heart.  The woman, on the other hand, will do anything to get even a little bit of love.  She has a lot of feminine energy.  She has a lot of heart, but not much spine.  Sure, there is plenty of polarity in this relationship, but there's much left to be desired. We call this the codependence stage, and room for growth within this kind of relationship is limited at best.                The second stage relationship is between the sensitive man and the independent woman.  This is a man who realizes that women want a guy who listens, who is in touch with his feelings, who has an open heart.  So he has taken it upon himself to bring more feminine yin energy into his life.  The woman in this kind of relationship is strong and independent.  Typically, she has a job with a lot of responsibility.  She can take care of herself financially and doesn't really need a man.  As such, she has brought a fair amount of masculine yang energy on board.                This is the independence stage.  Although this kind of relationship is a progression from the first, much of the polarity is lost in the feminizing of the man and the masculinizing of the woman.  Such relationships tend to fall flat after a while, and may very well be part of the reason behind the high divorce rates nowadays.  The man in this kind of relationship has a lot more heart than the first-stage fellow; however, in the process, he has lost much of his spine.                The third stage relationship is between the man as a spiritual warrior and the woman as a fully-realized goddess.  Here, the man is able and willing to take the woman deeper into her feminine essence than she could by herself.  And the woman, in turn, is able to guide the man deeper into his life's purpose than he could by himself.  I call this the stage of mutual flourishing.  The man in this kind of relationship has both heart and spine, both compassion and unwavering purpose.  He is the combination of the best elements of the man from the Stage 1 and Stage 2 relationships.  Notice also that in this stage, compared to Stage 1, both the man and the woman are adept at taking on the complementary energy (yin for men, yang for women) while the guy majors in masculine and the girl majors in feminine.            Man    Woman   Stage 1: Co-dependent   all spine, no heart   no spine, all heart   Stage 2: Independent   less spine, more heart   more spine, less heart   Stage 3: Mutual Flourishing   both spine and heart   both spine and heart The kind of guy you would want              Now that we've discussed the types of relationships that are possible with a man, it's easier to create a picture of the kind of man who would fit in that picture.  As we said before, you're much more likely to find something if you have a good idea of what you're looking for.  Throughout this book, we're going to talk about a prototype of a man with whom you're most likely to have a fulfilling relationship.  He's the fellow from the Third Stage relationship we described above – the spiritual warrior, the man with both compassion and purpose, heart and spine.  For short, henceforth I will call him the Good Guy, and we shall spend some time describing him in detail during the course of this book – things that will aid you in spotting him and inviting him into your life.                Now as you are sitting somewhere and reading this book, my dear reader, I don't really know you that well.  However, I assume that if you’ve taken it upon yourself to pick up this book, you are interested in a fulfilling relationship.  Fulfillment comes in many shapes and sizes, and the Tao of Dating is about giving you the tools to find that fulfillment, regardless of your starting point.  Roughly speaking, we'll categorize relationships into three categories by duration – short, medium and long-term – and see how each guy fits in.  Regardless of what constitutes your fulfillment, it helps if you enter into each kind of relationship consciously, knowing roughly what to expect.  Short-term relationships (also known as 'flings'). This is the kind of relationship you enter without expecting it to last long.  It could be anything from an evening's encounter to a one-week vacation romance to a summer-long fling.  The distinction here is your mindset: you are entering this relationship with few expectations as to long-term potential.                For this kind of relationship, any of the three kinds of men will probably do. However, there are ramifications.  The first-stage guy, masculine but not very heart-centered, is the one you're most likely to have fun with while managing a clean break at the end.  We'll call him Biff.  The second-stage guy – the sensitive guy, whom we will dub Lance – is the one most likely to be hurt at the end.  He'll probably try to keep in touch, calling and writing to tell you how much he misses you and how much you mean to him.  This could be sweet but annoying at the same time.  The third-stage guy – both strong and compassionate, whom we will call Victor – can handle whatever happens just fine.  However, you will be more likely to be hurt at the end, realizing how much he meant to you and wanting more from him than he may be able to offer.   Medium-term relationships (also known as 'serious relationship' or 'boyfriend').  There comes a time when you want to be with a man for the long term, but not necessarily forever.  You're ready for a lease, but maybe not a full purchase – a boyfriend, but not a husband.  You're not necessarily entering the relationship thinking, "Well, this is going to last a few months and then I'll be moving along," but in effect that's what it is.                Starting with this kind of relationship, it's best to toss out the Stage 1 guy completely.  Biff is at best a dessert, enjoyed sparingly; he is never a main course.  If you substitute dessert for real, nutritious food on a regular basis, you will be unhappy and unhealthy, which is precisely the effect of having a Biff in your life long-term.                The Stage 2 guy – Lance – is fine for this kind of relationship.  You have (and will have) many joyous, fulfilling relationships with Lance.  Just be aware that the full flourishing of you will probably not occur with a Lance, and so turning him into a marriage prospect, as sensible as it may seem at the moment, is likely to be a formula for long-term disappointment.  And we're all about enlightened self-interest here, which has your long-term fulfillment in mind.  He just may not be ready for you – ever.              Finally, there's Victor, the Stage 3 guy.  He would be great for this kind of relationship (or any kind, really).  The only issue is that if you're not on the market for marriage, you may not be ready for him.  Reverse disappointment is still disappointment, and teasing yourself with this amazing guy with whom you can't stay (for whatever reason) is something to consider. Long-term relationships (also known as 'marriage' or 'life partnership').  For this kind of relationship, I can only recommend the Stage 3 man.  You are long done with Biff, you can handle Lance fine but he can't handle you, and now you're ready for the real thing.  Although there are probably more Lances and Biffs than Victors, there are are still plenty of Victors out there, so keep an eye out for them.  The good news is that many Lances have the capacity to turn into Victors, especially when they are in relationship with a fully-realized goddess (that would be you).  If anything has the power to transform, it is love, so take heart.

Chapter 5. Understanding Men, Understanding Yourself               The purpose of this chapter is to give you some general insight into men's dating behavior.  After reading it, you may still not be able to predict guy behavior, but you'll have an outside chance of understanding it instead of being baffled by it.              Note that there are as many different types of men as there are males inhabiting this planet – about 3.2 billion of them so far.  Attempting to boil down this exceptionally diverse cohort into a handful of tidy generalizations would be an oversimplification that does disservice to both you and the men.  As Voltaire once said, "All generalizations are false, including this one."  It's still best to examine each male specimen that comes along your way on a case-by-case basis.              At the same time, there are some principles that hold true about male behavior most (but not necessarily all) of the time.  To paraphrase Shylock from Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, if you prick them they will bleed, if you tickle them they will laugh, and if you stand them up for a date they will be seriously bummed out.  Men are people, too.                Subsequent to a spate of popular psychology books from the 1990s, the myth that men and women behave so differently as to be from different planets seems to have taken hold in the public imagination.  Like most myths, these differences have not been supported by scientific evidence.  As far as I can tell, men are from Earth and women are, too, and human beings are much more similar than they are different, regardless of sex.  In fact, the behavioral and communicational differences between individual women (and between individual men) will be far greater than the differences between men and women as a group.                That said, there are some differences between the way men and women are built.  Some of these differences have behavioral ramifications, and entire books have been written on the subject (see Pease & Pease).  This book you are reading is about dating, so I will concentrate on what's relevant to that.                What's important here is to be cognizant of the differences.  This is the first step towards understanding and perhaps tolerating what you may perceive as men's quirks.  Remember – if almost all men exhibit a certain behavioral pattern, then it's not just a quirk.  It's just the way they are, just part of the Tao.  And, as some wise person once said, first seek to understand, then to be understood.  So, from an actual guy to you, let's find out how we tick. Why men are so damn horny              A fair amount of evidence points to men wanting sex and seeking it out far more often than women.  During the few hundred thousand years that human beings evolved on the savannah, sexual activity for a woman could potentially result in pregnancy, with its concomitant investment of resources, reduced mobility, and risk of death during childbirth.  In comparison, the cost of sexual activity for a male is a few milliliters of semen which he can regenerate in short order.  And, should there be a pregnancy, he’s not the one who has to carry and raise the child.                A simple way to understand the difference between male and female reproductive strategies is to answer this question for yourself: what is the maximum number of children a man and a woman could have in a year if each had sex with a different person every day?  It becomes immediately obvious that, in the genetic lottery, a man stands to gain a lot more from having multiple partners.  Hence the difference in sexual behavior.              That said, women are horny, too.  A famous diagram of sex drive (see Pease & Pease) shows that men's sex drive peaks in their teens and early twenties, then steadily declines.  Women's, on the other hand, rises steadily (always less than that of the men) until the late thirties and early forties, when it surpasses men's sex drive.  Perhaps that's where the expression 'dirty thirties' comes from.                Taoist philosophy says that one of the keys to living a good life is to observe the way the world is and then to flow with it, as opposed to trying to shoehorn the world into some notion of how you think it should be.  These notions manifest in various forms: religion, culture, local custom, family upbringing, fad, trend.  My definition of pain is wishing the world to be different than it is.  So, to avoid pain in your relationships with men, it's good to observe human sexuality and the patterns that have emerged over thousands of years and work with them, not against them.  You don't have to like the way it is, but you can at least make your peace with it. Pain is wishing the world to be different than it is. Making your peace with monogamy (or absence thereof)                            Primatologists have measured the ratio of testicle size to body weight in various primates and observed an interesting correlation.  Species with a high testicle-to-body-weight ratio, such as chimpanzees and bonobos, tend to be more promiscuous than species with a lower ratio, such as gorillas (who have sex maybe once a year).  Homo sapiens fits somewhere in between chimps and gorillas, which would predict that we humans would be chiefly monogamous with some excursions outside the pair bond.  Studies bear out what literature, history and our own experience hint at being true: both human males and females are inclined to engage in what anthropologists call extra-pair couplings, even within the context of a monogamous relationship.  Although both genders stray, men do it at a higher rate than women.              Strict monogamy is quite rare in the entire animal kingdom and may not exist at all[4].  And until recently, polygamy seems to have been more common than not.  Historically men were involved in aggression and war, and each battle reduced their numbers.  This led to a perennial shortage of men, making polygamy an effective survival strategy for the tribe so the widows were taken care of.  Thus it makes sense that one study showed a slight majority of human cultures studied all over the globe to be polygamous in nature.                Men have extra-pair couplings, and so do women.  A study conducted in England by zoologist Robin Baker between 1988 and 1996 revealed that the biological fathers of 10% of the population were not whom they expected it to be.  So be careful the next time you call someone a bastard.  You may be closer to the truth than you think.              Another study involving women rating the attractiveness of male faces showed an interesting result.  The women in the study usually preferred the more feminine-looking male faces except for when they were ovulating.  During that time, they had a marked preference for the more masculine-looking faces.  This may mean that, depending on time of the month, women pick different sex partners for different purposes: the more nurturing-looking ones for raising the family, and the more rugged-looking ones for sexy genes to pass on to their offspring.                The point of citing these studies and observations isn't to condone or condemn one type of behavior over another.  It's simply to tell you that these things happen, have been happening and will continue to happen.  If you see these tendencies for what they are without labeling, judging or getting all worked up about them, you'll probably have more peace of mind – and get more of what you want.              So if you come across a handsome, virile, well-to-do fellow that you fancy, be prepared for him not to be a celibate monk.  And if you two start dating, it's quite possible that he'll be seeing other women unless he tells you he's not.  And if you get married, know that even you yourself may someday have an office fling.  These things happen, so know them, expect them, plan for them, and place them in the larger context of your long-term fulfillment.  Monogamy need not be completely out of the question.  Just know that you don’t need to make something relatively uncommon an absolute requirement for your fulfillment. Know what you're getting yourself into              To put this all in practical terms, if you've started dating a man, it's possible that he will be seeing other women at the same time.  Just so there are no surprises for you, assume that until a man has made an explicit promise of sexual exclusivity to you, he will reserve the latitude to be intimate with other women.  In the meantime, you are free to date other men, too.              Although you may not be able to tell him what to do, you have control over setting your boundaries.  For health reasons and just to clarify where you stand, it's wise to know whether your date is having sexual relations with other people and decide how comfortable you are with that. A simple, direct question usually gets that information for you, provided it's at the appropriate time.  "When was the last time you had sex?" gets to the heart of the matter and is perfectly appropriate if you're already having sex or heading in that direction, especially if you preface it with your genuine concern for health.  If that's too direct for you, then "Are you seeing anyone else?" will usually yield the same information.                If you're considering sleeping with a man, you also have a right to know whether he's engaging in safer sex or not.  So ask him.  Be wary if you get anything but a simple, direct answer back.  If you feel that his behavior violates your values or endangers your health, you may wish to look elsewhere.  Of course, it goes without saying that you will always engage in safer sex. Kill the prince                            I noticed a curious irony when I was speaking to my friend Heather the other day.  I asked her about her weekend date, and she said, "Oh, I had a really great time.  This guy was really fun, good-looking, and we were laughing the whole time.  After the theater we went to this late night café and talked until 3am."   I said, "That's fantastic!  When are you going to see him again?"  She responded, "Well, I don't know.  I'm not sure if there's going to be a second date.  I didn't feel that instant chemistry, you know, those butterflies in your stomach, that tingle you get all over your body that says this guy is the one."                Well, that's interesting.  Clearly she's had a good time, and yet she's reluctant to follow up.  Sometimes this happens because she's had relationships in the past which have started with that 'big spark'.  But the irony is that all those relationships that started with intense chemistry and the big spark have ended, leaving her – single.  Those men aren't around anymore.  Although this does not invalidate those relationships, it does make one wonder if instant chemistry is indeed the prerequisite for a fulfilling long-term relationship.This leads us to an even bigger irony.  I always make a point of asking women in happy relationships – married or not – about how they first met their partners.  And before even getting started with the story, many of them say, "You know, the first time I met him I didn't really like him that much."  So it turns out that a lot of long-lasting relationships start with the woman disliking the guy somewhat, let alone having instant chemistry with him.Love is not a sudden burst of energy and excitement that overwhelms your neurology in an instant.  That's called a roller coaster, or a fireworks display, or infatuation, or panic attack.  Love is the sustained, ever-deepening appreciation of another person over time.  It is more like an edifice than a spectacle.  It takes time to build, and once built, it tends to last a while.  As Shakespeare said in Romeo and Juliet, "violent delights have violent ends."  A fulfilling long-term relationship may start this way.  Most don't.Yet some women look for a cataclysmic first meeting where bells go off, firecrackers shoot around, and the earth shakes beneath her feet.  He will be a prince in rust-free armor on a white horse, perfect in every way, and he will materialize to sweep her off her feet and whisk her away to the great kingdom of romance.  And he'll have ballet tickets.  Perhaps this has its roots in popular Western depictions of love in movies, television, romance novels and such.  What we have to realize is that these accounts of courtship are specific to Western culture.  In India, where the divorce rate is lower than in America, most marriages are arranged.  On their wedding day, the bride and groom may be meeting each other only for the first time!  And yet, after time, many learn to love one another and have a lasting union.  I am not at all recommending that you go and ask your parents to find you a suitable boy and give up on the whole dating thing.  What I do want is your empowerment and fulfillment.  The Western romantic model of relationships is a cultural construct, and one that isn't necessarily all that successful, considering the 50% divorce rate in the United States.  For something as important as fulfilling companionship, I believe you deserve better than a coin flip.  So release your attachment to the notion that you have to fall madly in love with someone in order to be fulfilled.  Passion is great, romance is great, but do bring a little bit of yang into the mix – a little bit of deliberation.  Madly in love is still mad, and mad people tend to make silly choices.              Now love at first sight does happen on occasion, and very rarely, you do get those butterflies in your stomach from the get-go.  That's great, but just remember that there's little correlation between the butterflies and whether a man can actually be a source of lasting fulfillment for you.  This is because the Prince, the perfect man, does not exist!  Moreover, researchers show that fulfilling long-term relationships happen between partners who are more or less equal.  This is called the equity theory of love.  So unless you're a princess yourself, then the prince is by definition not your equal, and your partnership with him is a setup for likely failure.  Eventually, a partner who feels he's bringing more to the relationship will become more demanding, impatient and dissatisfied, and the relationship founders.               Sometimes I hear from a friend that she's met 'the perfect man.'  This makes me cringe a little, because often it is a prelude to heartbreak.  Since the perfect man does not exist, she's expecting something that the world is not going to deliver, which is how you get pain and disappointment.  Real men inhabit the real world, and the real world is a dynamic, ever-changing place.  All good relationships are based on a measure of mutually acceptable compromise and influence.   You mold to him a little bit, he molds to you a little bit, and we have a good fit.  So even though there may not be a guy who's perfect, there is one who is perfect for you.  And you have the power to bring that perfection about. The perfect guy vs. the perfect guy for you              When I think of the Western idea of perfection, it's intertwined with notions of flawlessness.  At its essence, it is a hard, unforgiving concept.  The Eastern formulation is different and perhaps best embodied in the Zen parable of the broken cup.  The Zen master says that a broken cup is perfect because it is perfect at being what it is – a broken cup.  As long as you're not attempting to compare the broken cup to some idealized version of a cup without chips or cracks, then the broken cup is a perfect broken cup.  What makes it perfect is how you look at it.  If you accept the cup as it is, then it is perfect.  If you expect it to be a puppy, then it is not.              All human beings are like broken cups.  We are perfect at being who we are – no more, no less.  And in relationships, no partner will be perfect per se, but some will be perfect for you.  This softer, Eastern notion of perfection comes about when you choose to mold your mind around who a person already is.  It is, in essence, a creative act, and one that requires effort.                It is also an act of forgiveness – for the perceived faults of your partner, but most importantly, forgiveness for your own faults.  We tend to judge others to the same degree that we judge ourselves, so start with yourself.  Realize that you and I and everyone else are all still growing in this world, and make allowance for that.              Love, in many ways, is a choice.  For example, you may know someone who adopted a child, taking in a person who is a complete stranger with no blood relation and raising that individual as her own child.  In workshops, I have seen how after a few minutes of exercises, two total strangers can look into each others' eyes and absolutely see one another as the beloved.  So remember that you possess this gift.  You don't have to pick the next guy who comes around the corner and throw yourself at him, and you don't have to be super-picky and hold out for the prince, either.  You can tread the middle path – the path of the savvy woman who knows what she wants and knows where she can find it.   A big secret about how men relate to female beauty              I know women worry a fair amount about the whole beauty thing.  And yes, as a guy I can assure you that looks do matter.  But allow me to let you in on a little subtlety about how we view feminine beauty: men appreciate you for what you have to offer, not what you don't.                Let me illustrate that point.  Imagine that you're hungry and someone puts a great dinner plate of broiled salmon and fresh vegetables in front of you.  What's your reaction?  Do you think, "Wow! This is great!  Thank you so much!"  Or is it, "Well, it's food, but where's the lobster and truffles?  This is clearly not a dish from a 4-star restaurant!"              Most normal people would be thrilled to get the decent meal, even if it's not the best possible meal on the planet.  In fact, to compare it to some dish that's not there and then have it come up short is an act of imagination.  That requires additional effort and blood flow to the brain, which means that it effectively never happens (unless you're a big food snob).  This is why almost all of us loved our college experience: we only had one, and therefore nothing to compare it to.  So as far as we know, it was the best college experience possible! A man will appreciate you for what you have to offer, not what you don't.               So when you're with a guy who's into you, and it's just you and him – which is most of the time you're together – he's not going to sweat the little physical things you think matter.  He's too busy celebrating your company!  He doesn't care about your butt size, thigh size, breast size, less-than-flawless hair or any of that.  That stuff comes up, if ever, only when he's comparing you to other women -- and there are no women around!  And if you are the one who makes him feel like a million bucks, then even when there are other women around, he secretly knows that you're his gem that no one else has.  And if he's in love with you, you automatically become the most beautiful woman in the world.              Now let's examine the converse scenario.  Let's assume you're a contestant in the Miss Universe contest.  Ever seen one of those shows?  Now, even though a guy would be thrilled to be with any one of those young, beautiful women, when there's a bevy of 100 of them, he's going to start to get picky.  And suddenly Miss Venezuela doesn't look so great because she was standing next to Miss Brazil, who's more his type.                When you go out with a group of very attractive girlfriends, or head out to a place like a nightclub where everybody's all gussied up, you're putting yourself in a pageant-like situation.  This puts you at an instant disadvantage, since it makes it much more likely that you’ll be standing next to Miss Brazil, who may very well be more his type.              So emphasize your strengths and leave alone the rest.  Do your best to interact one-on-one with a man who interests you.  And for crying out loud, don't invite comparison or ask him what his type is.  If he's with you, you're his type.  And he appreciates you for what you are, not what you aren't.    He doesn't care that much about your shoes or dress              Here's another little secret: as long as you're presentable and alluring, men don't really pay all that much attention to the specifics of what you're wearing.  A man will be happy as long as your outfit is elegant and flattering.  So if you want to keep up with fashion or impress your girlfriends, go ahead, as long as you keep in mind that what's fashionable isn’t necessarily what men find appealing.  So if you want to dress for your girlfriends, be fashionable.  If you want to attract men, wear something elegant that emphasizes your best features, regardless of what’s in fashion at the time.   Your secret gift as a woman              The good news is that, as a woman, you are designed to see beyond short-term attractiveness (or unattractiveness) of a man to recognize what is deeper and more meaningful.  For better or for worse, men are designed to put a lot of importance upon a woman's appearance.  Things like hip-to-waist ratio, complexion and youthful appearance are surface proxies that evolution has chosen to signal fertility – and thus, desirability – in a woman.  Anecdotally, it is rare to see a handsome, well-to-do man with a woman who is not outwardly attractive, which bears out this point in the real world.  The converse situation, on the other hand, is common: very attractive women routinely associate and marry men who are not nearly as physically attractive.  Scientists believe that this is because during the course of human evolution, the survival of human offspring depended very much on the cooperation of the male partner.  Human infants are remarkably helpless, requiring nurturance for the better part of two decades before they can thrive on their own.  As such, the women who were very good at choosing male partners who were strong, reliable, long-term providers had offspring that did disproportionately better than the women who did not have that skill.  Those genes got passed on, and here we are.               This is a crude sketch of why women are willing to overlook certain characteristics in men, and we have seen enough versions of the rich older man/attractive younger woman couple to know that it is borne out in reality.  What you have to remember is that this is your gift as a woman.  It is part of the design of the universe, part of the Tao, that for you, beauty is more a feeling than a sight.  If a man makes you feel good, he will look good in your eyes.  Feeling good is the essence of fulfillment, so you have the extraordinary luck to be able to find fulfillment in all kinds of unexpected places.  As a woman, you possess the extraordinary gift of making a man who makes you feel good look good.               The more you use the Tao, the more you move with the Tao, the more it brings fulfillment to your life.  So be patient with yourself and with the men you meet.  If you actually enjoyed the company of a man, allow that to take its course.  See what happens for another meeting or two, even if thunderbolts did not descend from the heavens during the first date and he did not have a halo around his head by the end of it.  Love visits at unlikely moments.  And as Williamson said memorably in A Return to Love, there is one mistake in life, and that is not to let love in.  At the same time, chemistry (or more accurately, a certain chemical compatibility) is an essential part of any relationship and you will ignore it only to your peril.  As we will discuss later, listen to what your body is telling you.   Types of men              There are as many types of men as there are males on this planet, so it's unwise to pigeonhole a man and close his case.  At the same time, there are some useful classifications for figuring out who you're dealing with.  The purpose of the following archetypes is to increase your awareness and help you answer the following question:  "How likely is this man to be a source of long-term fulfillment for me?"                I like the heart and spine classification because of its simplicity.  It gets down to what really matters in a man.  Here are the four categories and some types that you may encounter in each: No heart, no spine.  Needless to say, this is not the kind of person you'd want to involve yourself with.  If you were meant to hang out with jellyfish, you'd live in the ocean. Lots of heart, not a lot of spine.  This is the nice guy.  He can communicate his feelings, he's in touch with his feminine side, and in the end, he will annoy you because he either doesn't stand up for himself or have clear direction and purpose in life.  Earlier, we called him Lance. Lots of spine, not a lot of heart.  Stands up for himself just fine – and mostly just for himself.  Bad boys fall in this category, as do macho men, successful and super-driven businessmen who have no time for you, and all manner of bullies and petty tyrants.  We called him Biff in Chapter 4. Plenty of spine, plenty of heart.  This is the domain of the Good Guy, or Victor as we dubbed him. Why good women get involved (and stay) in bad relationships              When I was younger, I always noticed that many of my beautiful, accomplished, sweet and brilliant female friends dated men who did not treat them nearly well enough.  Turns out that powerful reasons drive such phenomena, so my friends weren't entirely crazy.  Once you know why good women end up dating jerks, then you can use your awareness to prevent such a thing from happening in the future to yourself or a friend.              Some of why good women end up in bad relationships has to do with their self-concepts and self-esteem.  And some of why they stay in them has to do with what I call the slot machine model of human behavior and sunk costs.  Let's talk about the slot machines first. The slot machine model of human behavior              Let's say you're in Las Vegas, and you've decided to play a slot machine.  You put in a coin, pull the lever, and – nothing.  Well, that's fine – you weren't expecting to win immediately anyway.  So you put in another coin and – nothing again.  In fact, nothing is the most likely outcome every time.  Funny that.                But before you know it, you've sunk quite a few coins in this machine.  Now you're thinking, "I'm invested; I can't just quit now!  I've fattened this thing up – it's going to pay off any second now!  Jackpot city!"                The fact remains that the most likely outcome of your next pull (and the next, and the next, and the next) is still nothing.  And that likelihood does not change whether you put in one coin or 10,000 coins before this pull.                Psychologists have noticed that one of the reasons why this happens (and why casinos are making a mint) is that the human mind grasps poorly the concept of sunk costs.  Those first 100 coins that you put into the machine are gone forever, and they have no bearing upon the outcome of the next pull of the lever.  People tend to mistake the sunk cost for an investment, which has an expectation of future payoff commensurate with the investment.  A sunk cost, on the other hand, is just plain gone.              The way this concept plays out in a bad relationship is that the aggrieved party thinks that she has invested two years dating a jerk, so she can't just throw that investment away.  Besides, through her efforts, he might reform and thereby reward her with the jackpot she's been working on all along.                Well, there is no way to retrieve or throw away those two years – they're gone for good.  They are sunk costs.  And the jackpot isn't coming.  Just as in playing a slot machine, the best policy once you realize you're in a sunk cost situation is to cut and run and immediately stop your losses.  The sooner a woman leaves behind the jerk, the sooner she's opening her life to the arrival of a guy (perhaps even a Good Guy) who can be a catalyst of fulfillment.              Why does this happen?  I can think of a few reasons.  The first has to do with a hormone called oxytocin.  As far as we can tell so far, oxytocin has three main functions: it promotes powerful contractions of the uterus to expel the infant during childbirth; it promotes breastfeeding; and it creates a sense of bonding.  The bigger the dose of oxytocin, the greater the sense of bonding.  The whopping dose of oxytocin that bathes the brain during childbirth is part of the reason why mothers remain deeply in love with their babies for life.              An interesting feature of oxytocin is that it is released as a result of touch and at the moment of orgasm.  So whenever a woman gets sexually intimate with a man, especially when she experiences an orgasm with him, she is bonding with him more closely.  This bonding occurs at a deep, unconscious level and no amount of rational thought can undo it.  In fact, psychologists conducted a study showing that a small whiff of oxytocin administered nasally was enough to make people far more trusting of total strangers (Kosfeld et al., 2005).                So if you're one of those good women who has been spending far too much time with a bad match, consider whether it is your good sense speaking or the oxytocin.  Like any hormone or drug, withdrawal results in exponential decay of the effects.  So one way of breaking the bond between you and Mr. Wrong is to stay away from him.  A trip is often an excellent idea.              The reason why good women end up with bad men in the first place (and stay with them) has much to do with self-esteem and the self-concept.  The self-concept and how it affects your relationships              How you perceive yourself has a significant effect on the companions you pick and the relationships you have.  Self-concepts are the beliefs and judgments we have about ourselves.  Some of them are objective: "I am a 32-year old female."  Some are subjective: "I am likable."  Self-esteem is one of those subjective aspects of the self-concept, corresponding roughly to how much we like ourselves.                Psychological research shows that in the context of relationships, our self-concepts try to fulfill two functions.  First is to seek feedback from others that enhances the self-concept.  Second is to seek feedback that is consistent with the self-concept (Sedikides & Strube, 1997).                It's easy to understand why we would seek out compliments and positive feedback that make us feel good about ourselves and allow us to see ourselves as attractive and competent.  But what about consistency?  Turns out that we all have a strong drive to avoid cognitive dissonance by seeking out a world that is consistent with our beliefs.  As stated by psychologist Carol Brehm, "our self-concepts... make life predictable and sustain coherent expectations about what each day will bring."  Without them, "social life would be a confusing, chaotic jumble."                 Now here's where things get interesting.  If you happen to like yourself, then the self-enhancement drive coincides with the self-consistency drive, and all is well.  If you're around people who are saying nice things about you, then you are getting the self-enhancement ("You're great!") that is consistent with your self-concept, which is that you're a nice person ("I'm great!").  Life is hunky-dory.              However, if you don't happen to like yourself very well, you run into a problem.  Psychologists find that you will still like getting praise and compliments from others – this much seems to be an automatic, unconscious response.  But once you have a chance to think about it, you will come to distrust the positive feedback (Swann et al., 1990).               How does this affect your romantic life?  It seems that in the context of dating, self-enhancement is the primary drive, and everyone likes companions who are supportive, kind and accepting of who we are.  However, for long-term, committed relationships, self-consistency becomes more important.  This is such a prevalent phenomenon that it even has a name: the marriage shift (Swann et al., 1994).                                The way this plays out is rather interesting (and may even sound familiar).  If a person has good self-esteem, then hallelujah – she will gravitate towards people who accept and cherish her as she is and tend to stay with those people.                However, if she has a negative self-concept, initially, she will enjoy the compliments and positive feedback.  But over time, the self-consistency instinct will rise up and ask questions along the lines of, "Well, he can't really believe I'm that great.  What's wrong with him?"                              Eventually, the dissonance between the positive feedback she's receiving and the low self-concept will be so great that it creates feelings of inauthenticity and distrust ("He's just saying this stuff; he can't possibly be sincere") and leads to the dissolution of the relationship.              This is part of the reason why those wonderful female friends of mine dated and even married men who treated them poorly.  Those women were not crazy; they were simply ending up with men who fulfilled their self-concept.                If you can look back on your long-term relationships and count off a series of partners whose treatment of you made all your friends scratch their heads, then the problem may lie with your self-esteem.                              How to improve your self-esteem              The good news is that self-concepts can change, and you can enhance your self-esteem even if you think it's a little low (but not rock-bottom).  The ease with which someone can change her self-concept has to do with how sure she is with her self-concept right now (Swann & Ely, 1984).  If she's convinced she's totally unworthy, that's tough to turn around.  Luckily, that's rare, and even people who have low self-esteem only suspect that they're total dweebs but aren't quite sure.  In that case, here are two things that can turn your self-esteem around. Allow positive feedback.  Even if you start out with low self-esteem, kind words from an adoring lover can turn that around in short order as you start to enjoy and even believe what he says.  So whenever you hear a compliment, stop, take it in, and allow it to sink in.  Resist the reflex downer comments like, "Well, you don't really mean that" or "Well sure I have nice hair but look what a mess it is."  Just take the darned compliment and say only "Thank you."  Or even better, "You're absolutely right – thank you."  Positive feedback from others also helps, so surround yourself with appreciative people who prop you up and spend less time with those who bring you down.  The compliments are coming at you all the time if you only pay attention, so -- pay attention!  And accept them with open arms. Engage in service.  We get a lot of our sense of self-esteem by how useful we feel we are.  So go ahead and make yourself useful!  Nobody's stopping you.  Tutor some kids, volunteer at a shelter, sign up as a Big Sister, help out at church.  Go to a website like volunteermatch.org and find a project you can pour yourself into.                There is no faster way to feel worthy than to serve.  Not only will you feel like your services are useful and necessary, you will also exercise dormant talents which you may have never thought you had.  And scientists have shown that altruistic behavior actually lights up your brain's pleasure center.  In his book Why Good Things Happen to Good People, Professor of Bioethics Stephen Post has shown that people who volunteer benefit from improved mood, reduced anxiety and depression, better relationships, and even increased lifespan.  Doing good makes you feel good every time.  And it's a lot cheaper (and safer) than drugs. How to spot bad boys              We talked about noticing aspects of your own behavior that are relevant to your fulfillment.  For example, if you're chronically getting in the way of your own happiness through self-deprecation, that's useful to know (and, by the way, stop doing that already.  Thanks.).  Equally important is to notice behaviors of potential male companions which bear on your fulfillment.              This section is for those of you who find yourselves occasionally (or serially) involved with bad boys only to regret the episode afterwards.  If you've never had a problem with bad boys and  don't think you ever will, you may also skip this section.  If you like bad boys and can handle them just fine, then skip this section.  If you've ever found a bad boy even slightly appealing and think you could someday get involved with one, read on.              There's something attractive about bad boys, which is why smart women need to be able to spot them before getting involved with one, because they're just so darn tasty sometimes.  In a way, getting involved with a bad boy is like obesity: prevention is the best solution.  If it's already happened, it's often too late, and the solutions are laborious and ineffective.  So unless you're signing up for a relationship of limited duration with a definite expiration date, you're better off avoiding the bad boy altogether.  Also, because of the particularly heady brew of chemicals bad boys induce in your head and body, getting involved with a bad boy makes it more difficult to recognize and appreciate a Good Guy.  Don’t tell me I didn’t warn you.              My definition of a bad boy is simple: he is a boy (as opposed to a man) who is bad for you in the long term.  By bad I mean that overall, he will bring more pain to your life than joy.  Don't get me wrong: there will be some good times with the bad boy.  That's why women get involved with them.  But the net result tends to be more pain than joy.                By you I mean the whole of your life: your mental, spiritual, physical and financial well-being.  No one item here absolutely certifies a person as a bad boy; however, the occurrence of several of these characteristics in one individual should be a warning sign.                Incidentally, a man's number of sexual partners is not necessarily an indicator of whether he's a bad boy or not.  This is all about how he treats you in the long term.  It would be just as foolish to let go of a sexually experienced man who loves you and treats you like the queen of the universe as it would be to attach yourself to a monk who disrespects you. In any case, always expect a genuinely desirable man to have been noticed by women before you.               If I were to pick one quality that would be the most accurate indicator of whether someone's a bad boy, it's a presence of extremes.  Whether of beauty, wealth, intelligence, tidiness, messiness, neglect or solicitude, extremes are tipoffs that this guy might be a handful who'll bring you more trouble than it's worth.  The Tao is about taking the middle path;  those who court extremes are not with the Tao.  If you bring those people into your life, you may be inviting instability and trouble.  Chapter 29 of the Tao Te Ching says: The sage sees things as they areAnd takes the middle path,Away from the extremes.               Every characteristic listed here is like a double-edged sword: the very thing that makes it appealing can also render it detrimental.  The list is intended to make you aware and wary of whether you're signing up for the fun or the pain.  Whenever you spot one of these list items, ask yourself: "What's the purpose of this behavior?  What's he trying to get out of it?"  Put yourself in his motorcycle boots for a moment, and you'll gain instant insight into the male mind.              Don't get me wrong -- bad boys can be a lot of fun, and the totally nice guys might be pretty deathly boring.  The purpose of this is, first and foremost, your awareness so you can choose a middle path.  You want a guy who has a little bit of an edge and is decent to boot.              Here are some behaviors that could mean you're dealing with a bad boy, and how your mind may rationalize it as appealing rather than problematic.  Caveat emptor: Moving things along too quickly.  Bad boys tend to make early declarations of affection – genuinely or for effect.  They also fall in love easily and have no problem proposing a romantic weekend getaway when they've known you for less than fifteen minutes.  What it looks like: Spontaneity and joie de vivre.What it could really be: Impulsiveness; trying to get into your pants as swiftly as possibleWhat you're signing up for if you date him: plans only made at the last minute; plans cancelled at the last minute; general irresponsibility; similarly impulsive overtures to other women. Being just a tad too smooth.  When you first meet him, does he touch you too early and too often?  Is he whispering in your ear?  Is he overly generous with his compliments?  Does he attempt to take you away from your friends and get you alone?  Is he always subtly (or blatantly) pushing the boundary of what's appropriate and comfortable?  Is he telling stories that seem too well-rehearsed and designed to aggrandize him, impress you, and get you worked up?  Is there a lot of showmanship going on?  Once you've started dating, are his excuses for marginal behavior all too plausible?  If so, you are almost certainly dealing with a bad boy.What it looks like: Romance! These men know that this is the ultimate bait for getting a woman, and therefore use it skillfully and without apology. What it could really be: Too good to be true is almost always exactly that.  Deliberately seductive behavior usually means you're dealing with an experienced player. What you're signing up for if you date him: sexual infidelity (and possibly diseases); unreliability; rapid emotional detachment once he's gotten what he wants from you. Thrillseeking behavior.  He rides a motorcycle – a big Harley, actually.  He skydives, takes all kinds of drugs, drinks a lot, goes out five times a week or more, and generally looks for the adrenaline rush.What it looks like: A life of excitement that you want to be a part of.What it could really be: Although many grown, responsible men take calculated risks, chronic thrillseeking is often a sign of immaturity and recklessness.  What you're signing up for if you date him: worry; genuine fear; loneliness as he goes off on his jaunts; infidelity; irresponsibility; run-ins with the law. Devil-may-care attitude.  He lives by his own rules – and only by his own rules.  He dresses like he wants, works when he wants, eats what he wants, says what he wants.  'No one will the boss of me' is his motto.What it looks like: Fierce, roguish independence.What it could really be: Lack of consideration and antisocial behavior, which will inevitably extend to you as well.What you're signing up for if you date him: inability to make plans, or broken plans when he does make them; verbal abuse; insensitivity to your feelings and desires; financial distress. Studied physical appearance.  A stylish man is good to find.  However, you can tell if a man has spent more time than normal on his appearance for effect.  Too disheveled goes in the same category as too slick: extremes are what you're watching out for.  Heavy cologne is often a tip-off. What it looks like: Style, baby, style.What it could really be: Narcissism and vanity.What you're signing up for if you date him: Player tendencies; mistreatment; self-absorption. General evasiveness.  When a man is evasive about personal questions – especially about dating, the women in his life, the length of relationships and such – beware.  He may be doing it for sport, but chances are he has something to hide.  A good relationship is based on honesty, trust and respect.  Chronic evasiveness precludes all three, so this is an inauspicious start to things. Incidentally, if a man lies to you even once for non-humanitarian reasons (e.g., only something like "There's no one hiding in the attic from the secret police" is acceptable), that's grounds for leaving him.What it looks like: Mystery and intrigue.What it could really be: Skeletons in the closet.  What you're signing up for if you date him: Unreliability; mistrust; lies.  Living space that's too well thought-out or too messy.  Psychologists talk about the concept of thin-slicing: how from one snapshot of a person's life you can intuit fairly accurate information about his character.  In fact, psychologists showed in an experiment that walking through a person's uninhabited apartment yielded a more accurate character assessment than an interview with that person (Gosling et al., 2002).               As such, the well-appointed love nest and the messy bachelor pad are both potential signs of trouble ahead.  A man's chic apartment with the bearskin rug in front of the fireplace, four-poster canopied bed, strategically positioned Art of Sensual Massage on the coffee table and scented candles everywhere should make you wonder why he created this ambience from which a woman would supposedly find it difficult to escape – and how many women preceded you and will succeed you.  On the other end of the spectrum, the dishevelment of the messy apartment should make you wonder whether that's the level of consideration with which he'll be treating you.What it looks like: Good taste (love nest), endearingly boyish disorder (messy bachelor pad).What it could really be: A player.What you're signing up for if you date him: See 'Being too smooth' entry above. Lack of consideration.  Did he ask you out far enough in advance so you'd be able to make plans?  Did he call ahead of time to say he was going to be late?  Did he open your car door for you?  Did he offer to pay when he invited you out?  Did he ask about your sick cat when you said she was sick?  How about your sick grandmother?  How about when you were sick?  Does he offer you his coat when you look cold?  I'm belaboring the point here, and what I'm saying is this: you know what consideration looks like, and it's different from when a guy's being a jerk to you.  Any one of these things is not a big deal, but a bunch of them happening in close succession is a sign of trouble.What it looks like: Non-conformity, roguish independence.What it could really be: A jerk.What you're signing up for if you date him: see Devil-may-care attitude above. Indecision.  This is one of the characteristics that truly separates the men from the boys: can he decide?  Decision means leadership, leadership means responsibility, and responsibility means power.  An indecisive man is a powerless man.  If he waffles and weaves with every decision he makes, or even worse, consults you for all his decisions, run.  Better a man who decides and is wrong on occasion than one who refuses to decide at all.  Of all the characteristics mentioned here, this may very well be the worst.  Just stay away.  What it looks like: Sensitivity and consideration.What it could really be: Spinelessness, weakness.What you're signing up if you date him: Exasperation, ruined plans, total disaster. Highly selective availability or too much availability.  Again, you have to ask yourself why this is the case, because there are usually good reasons for extreme unavailability or availability.  A man with highly selective availability is often seeing other women or married to one.  A man who's always available may be unemployed or desperate.  Either way, keep your eyes open. What it looks like: Busy, important man-about-town (unavailable one) or a guy who's really, really into you (highly available one).What it could really be: A man with too many or too few options.What you're signing up for if you date him:  A man who will either keep you hanging on or will be always hanging on you.  How to spot Good Guys              We've discussed how to spot the kind of man you'd rather avoid.  How about the kind of man you would want to have in your life – the Good Guy?  Here's a field guide to spotting the keepers.  What's interesting about these characteristics is that they are harder to spot than the ones for the Bad Boys.  It will take more time and effort to discover the Good Guy's best qualities precisely because of the kind of person he is.  Treasures are often buried.  The bigger they are, the more digging they require.                It's unlikely that any one person will have all of these characteristics at once.  Moreover, to get too picky about the kind of man you want to associate with would be a negation of the principle of abundance.  The purpose of this list is to prime your conscious and subconscious mind such that when one of these features pops up, you will know what it means.  Sense of purpose.  This is the foundational characteristic of the mature masculine and the source of the Good Guy's power.  Since the Good Guy is the embodiment of the mature masculine, then he will always have a strong sense of purpose and direction in his life.  He knows what he's doing with his life and why and has a plan for achieving his goals.Signs to look for: Has set and achieved a number of life goals; has a list of goals, written or not, that he'd like to achieve; fills his time with activities that are aligned with his purpose. Humility.  Although he is aware of his own powers, he is also aware that the world is much bigger than he is.  This grounds him, giving him a great sense of awe and humility.  He recognizes that his talents are a tool for service to the world, as opposed to an instrument for self-aggrandizement and appeasing his ego.  Signs to look for: Mild tendency towards self-effacement; underreporting his achievements; greater interest in talking about you rather than himself.  Decisiveness.  A Good Guy knows that his job is to take care of things.  Since part of that involves making lots of decisions, he has gotten good at that.  He trusts his instincts and renders decisions efficiently.  He would rather make a decision quickly and then change his mind rather than dwell on it until it's too late.  Because of his decisiveness and the quality of his decision-making, people around him come to trust him, too.  In the presence of a trustworthy man, the divine feminine has a chance to relax and express itself.  Signs to look for: Makes decisions efficiently without dithering. Trustworthiness.  A Good Guy's word is a Good Guy's honor.  If he says he's going to call you in two days, he calls you in two days.  If he says he's going to pick you up at 7:15, he shows up at 7:15. Signs to look for: Does what he says when he says he's going to do it; gets genuinely angry on occasion without trying to sugarcoat it or suppress the anger. Consideration.  Lao Tzu says in Chapter 67 of the Tao Te Ching: I have three treasures to keep and hold:Compassion, economy and humility. The way people manifest compassion is in their ability to put themselves in someone else's shoes.  The way people show that in their behavior is in what we call consideration.  We hold the door open for someone walking in behind us because we know a door in our face is no fun and do not want someone else to experience that.  Similarly, a compassionate man will demonstrate consideration towards you and everyone else around him, from the waiter to the parking valet to an employee.Signs to look for: Does all the things thought of as well-mannered; remembers birthdays, anniversaries, and your preferences and does something about them; tips well; treats subordinates well; gets along with kids.  Strong internal compass.  The chief feature that distinguishes a man from a boy is the same as what distinguishes a woman from a girl: an internal frame of reference.  When a man has a strong internal frame of reference, he makes decisions based on what constitutes his fulfillment, as opposed to looking to outside sources for approval.  For better or for worse, one of these outside sources is sometimes you.  Therefore, somewhat paradoxically, the Good Guy is not the one who caters to your every whim and desire, but rather the one who has his own enlightened self-interest in mind.                  Part of being the embodiment of the divine masculine involves the ability to stand firm amidst the passions and vicissitudes of the divine feminine, the most likely source of which will be you.  The man who easily bends to your will, then, is not necessarily the one you want (you will get bored with him – trust me on this one).  The one who listens to you, weathers the storm of your passion, and still renders rational decisions based on what's best for everyone in the long term, is a much better bet.  You may not necessarily agree with him all the time, but you do respect him for his solidity.  This breeds further trust and allows the flourishing of the divine feminine in you.Signs to look for: Stands up for himself without being argumentative; is not afraid to contradict you (in a non-hysterical way) on occasion. Equanimity.  The Good Guy is a calm man.  He keeps his cool even when the world presents challenges to him – especially when the world presents challenges to him.  Things just don't bother him that much.  The way he handles challenges is not through whining or complaining, but rather through action (see decisiveness entry above).  Very rarely he may get angry about something that genuinely upsets him, but he does not dwell on it.  Although he is a passionate individual, he has learned how to channel his passion in an organized, constructive way.Signs to look for: Grace in the presence or absence of pressure.               As a side note, you're probably noticing how all these characteristics dovetail into one another.  Equanimity is related to the internal compass, which in turn relates to decisiveness.  Humility and compassion go hand-in-hand and are related to the last feature: acceptance. Acceptance. One of the central principles of Taoist philosophy is accepting the world as it is instead of trying to struggle against it.  Chapter 29 of the Tao Te Ching, one of my favorite which I have drawn upon several times in this book, expresses this principle succinctly: Those who try to fix the world fail. The world is sacred; it can't be improved.Those who tamper with it harm it.Those who grasp at it lose it.There’s a time for leading, and a time for following;A time for blowing hot, and a time for blowing cold;A time for motion and a time for rest;A time for  vigor, and a time for exhaustion;A time for beginning, and a time for ending..The sage sees things as they areAnd takes the middle path, away from the extremes. The Good Guy understands this.  Therefore he accepts himself.  From Chapter 30 of the Tao Te Ching: The good are effective.They achieve results but are not proudThey achieve results but do not boast.They achieve results but are not coercive. The Good Guy is in control, but not controlling.  Because he accepts himself fully, he is able to accept you fully.  This means that he will not try to fix you – he will have chosen you because you are already what he desires.  He will not rail against the world because it does not conform to his will.  Rather, he will flow with it.  Signs to look for: being comfortable in his own skin and generally tolerant of others. The Good Guy's secret turn-on              I'm about to let you in on a big secret on how to make the dating dance significantly easier and more fun for yourself, especially if you find it a challenge to meet men.  And the secret is this: an available man loves to be approached by a woman.  Especially if he is the right kind of man.              What women do not realize is that men are terrified of rejection.  I have spoken and written to thousands of them, and that is by far their biggest fear in dating.  So even though they may look like invincible hulks of self-confidence on the outside, all of them secretly cower inside at your power to utter that dread syllable: "NO."                This explains why you have so many men who have taken considerable time and effort to show up to a venue and then spend the next three hours chatting with their male buddies or twisting swizzle sticks instead of meeting the nice ladies who are there specifically to meet them.                Recently, I asked ten thousand of my male readers to recount a specific episode where a woman did something that was particularly appealing.  The answers all boiled down to two things: showing appreciation and taking initiative.  So taking the initiative turns out to be one of the most attractive things you can do when interacting with a man.  In Chapter 9, we will elaborate on how to make it incredibly easy to get the interaction started with any man practically anywhere.  Good Guys love it when you take initiative. The dilemma of dating the Great Man              Some of you will have the opportunity to date truly extraordinary men.  These are men who have excelled in their fields of endeavor, be it science, art, spirituality, leadership, business, or sports, and may have even achieved some renown.  They aren't just Good Guys – they're really Good Guys.  Let's call them Great Men.              Should you have the opportunity to get involved with one of these Great Men, there's something you need to know.  The extreme manifestation of any trait tends to become its own opposite.  And so when a Good Guy becomes really, really good, he becomes in effect – you guessed it – a bad boy.                Let me illustrate.  If he's a powerful guy and very sociable, he's going to be very smooth.  Because he doesn't have a lot of time and he's used to getting his way, he'll want to move things along quickly.  Because he likes to challenge himself, he's likely to be a thrillseeker.  He's a powerful guy, so he's not going to care too much what others think of him.  He's a man of status, power and perhaps wealth that other women have noticed, so he's going to have some options for companionship.  So for all the world he looks like a bad boy on the surface.              Greatness is both boon and burden, and it will always impinge upon the close relationships of the Great Man.  The rewards of being with a Great Man can be significant, so if you have the patience and strength to put up with the burdens, perhaps it's right for you.  I'm not here to prescribe you a course of action, but rather to increase your awareness so you can make better decisions.                Every Great Man may not be a pain in the rear, but it happens often enough to be worth mentioning.  My job is to ensure that you are as well-informed as possible, and so I want you to know what you're signing up for when you choose to get involved with a Great Man – specifically, a bit of trouble.  Gandhi beat his wife, neglected his family and got himself assassinated, which is enough to ruin any relationship.  Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy philandered and made their share of enemies.  Any number of renowned composers, musicians, artists and writers seriously tried their partners' patience with various excesses.  It's up to you to pick the kind of trouble you're willing to put up with and to find it exhilarating or annoying.  Every relationship involves a degree of compromise; just know what you're getting yourself into.

### ✨ When a superior woman hears of the Tao,She immediately starts to practice it.When an average woman hears of the Tao,She is of two minds about it.When a foolish woman hears of the Tao,She laughs at it loudly.If she didn't laugh, it wouldn't be the Tao.Thus it is said:The way into the light seems dark,The way forward seems to go back,The easy way seems hard,True virtue seems unreal,True purity seems sullied,True abundance seems insufficient,True steadfastness seems fickle,True clarity seems obscure,The greatest music has the faintest notes,The greatest capacities develop latest,The greatest form has no shape.The Tao is hidden and nameless..Yet the Tao alone nourishes and fufills all things.– Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching, Ch.


Chapter 1. Dating for Fulfillment Which would you prefer: the menu or the food?              Imagine that you’re hungry right now at a diner.  And they offer you just the menu but no food.  Would you settle for that?  Or would you demand actual food?                That may seem like a silly question.  But in real life, people sometimes operate as if they aren't sure about the answer.  They chase down the symbol representing what we want – money, titles – instead of the actual thing that we want.  But the money and the titles are only as good as the feelings and experiences they can get for us.                So while reading this book, I'd like you to keep in mind what constitutes real fulfillment for you in the dating realm – the actual food, not the menu.  Because fulfillment is not a person – it's a feeling.  The right person is the one who catalyzes an abundance of fulfilling feelings in your life, like love, peace and contentment.  If you're not getting those feelings, it may be a sign that you're either with the wrong person or that you could approach matters with an even better perspective.              Square one: accept and love yourself now              Some argue that the ultimate aim of everything we do in life is to get more love.  You could be reading this book because you want more love from men, more love from your friends, or more love from yourself.  Of those three, only one is directly under your control – the love you have for yourself.  Generally speaking, being better with men won’t make your friends like you any better (and sometimes may have the opposite effect).  And chances are that if you are not happy with yourself right now, no amount of success with men will ever make up for that.  And no man will be able to trigger feelings of fulfillment in you.              In fact, it only gets harder when you have what you thought would make you happy and still find happiness elusive.  So go ahead and decide now to be comfortable in your own skin and to accept yourself exactly as you are.  Why?  Besides being a good starting point, there is no time when it’s not right now.  Now is the only time.  And true fulfillment can only come from sharing your joy, contentment and self-sufficiency with the rest of the world in the present moment.  Decide it, claim it, be it. Be content with what you have and who you areAnd you cannot be harmed.                            – Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching, Ch. 44              So if you’re perfectly okay right where you are, why would you need this book?  Great question.  It reminds me of an old Buddhist saying: “We are perfect as we are, and we could all use a little work.”  Here's one way to think about it.  Seeking out resources for self-improvement simply means that you are on a journey of growth.  And in order to reach your goals in dating – or anything else in life – it's important to believe that at every point along this journey of growth, you are complete.  A sequoia seedling is always a sequoia at every point along its path to becoming a towering tree.  And so are you always an empowered, fulfilled woman on your way to even greater empowerment and fulfillment.  You are always turning into the best possible version of you.               This is important because the world tends to be a reflection of your dominant thoughts.  When you signal to the world "I am okay," the world will agree with you.  When you signal “Well, I’ll be okay if I just get this little part fixed, but I’m not quite okay right now,” then the world will agree with you also.                Recognize that whatever mindset you have right now is the one you're likely to carry with you for the rest of your life.  If you don't think you're okay right now, chances are that no events or circumstances will change that.  Thus I encourage you to choose right now to adopt the mindset that, wherever you are, regardless of your real or imagined inadequacies, you accept yourself just as you are.  Stop the struggle and just be.  Chapter 29 of the Tao Te Ching puts it thus: Those who try to fix the world fail. The world is sacred; it can't be improved.Those who tamper with it harm it.Those who grasp at it lose it.There’s a time for leading,And a time for following;A time for blowing hot,And a time for blowing cold;A time for motionAnd a time for rest;A time for  vigor,And a time for exhaustion;A time for beginning,And a time for ending..The sage sees things as they are,And takes the middle path,Away from the extremes.

Fulfillment is a feeling, not a person              The most common question I get from my readers is "How do I get this guy?"  The answer is simple: you're asking the wrong question.                Deep down, women seek relationships not because they want a particular guy, but rather because they want the feelings that a good relationship brings them.  This class of feelings I call fulfillment.  Fulfillment is having someone to see that movie with, someone to cook dinner for (or to cook for you), someone to take with you to your best friend's wedding, someone to cuddle up with on a Friday night.              A big mistake in relationships is focusing on the person instead of the fulfillment.  The object of your desire could be the most exceptional man on earth, but if he lives 5 hours away or is a workaholic and is never around when you want his company, chances are you are not going to be fulfilled in the long run.                When you are dating someone, ask yourself often, "Do I feel fulfilled in this relationship?" and answer that question with utter honesty.  If the answer is 'no' at any point, you may wish to reconsider your situation.  The flip side of that is when you do feel fulfilled for the most part, but there are some points of conflict looming in your mind.  In that case, you may wish to weigh the relative importance of those peccadilloes compared to the fulfillment you're already experiencing.               Another issue with seeking out a particular man as the key to your fulfillment is that by doing so, you are denying the abundance of the world.  When you chase anything in life, you are affirming its lack in your life.  Spiritual law holds that the world tends to mirror your dominant thoughts.  So if you affirm the lack of something in your life, be it wealth, companionship or health, the world will agree with you, and that thing will be driven farther away from your reach.  We'll discuss this topic further in Chapter 5 on Beliefs.              Now one sure way to chase away your own fulfillment is to compare yourself to others:  Jane has a better-looking, better-educated boyfriend who cooks for her; Barbara's boyfriend is marriage-minded, etc.  Comparison gets you in trouble because comparing yourself with those whom you perceive as better off can make you bitter.  Comparison with those whom you perceive as worse off can make you vain (and frankly, bitter and vain people are a bit of a drag to be around).  If you’re ever going to compare, compare yourself to your former self, and notice how far you have come along.  And stay centered on your fulfillment, which will be different from that of anyone else. The power of gratitude              So what constitutes a more effective approach than wishing, wanting, needing, and yearning your way into a fulfilling relationship?  The secret weapon here is called gratitude.  The idea is simple: right now, if you are sitting somewhere and reading this book, chances are you have a roof over your head and are clothed and fed.  You probably have a job and friends and family who care for you.  Trillions of cellular operations are all working in harmony this very second to keep you alive and functioning.  There is no end to the things you could be grateful for.                Of course, you have a choice.  You could focus on what's missing from your life – a 70-ft yacht on the French Riviera, a villa in Tuscany or a doting, movie-star boyfriend or husband.  Or you can focus on the infinitude of things that are right with your life (and there are billions of them, I assure you).  Focusing on the billions of things that are right with your life is more likely to make you feel good than focusing on the few things that you perceive as missing.  Try this fun little exercise to get a better sense of what I mean. Exercise 1. The Power of FocusTake about 30 seconds right now to look around the room.  Take notice and mentally catalog everything in the room that is brown, and do your best to remember as many of them as possible.  Look around and do that now; when you are done, continue reading.                 Now, while keeping your eye on the page, recall all the items in the room that are green.  Green?  Yes, green.  You probably didn’t come up with many, since you were so focused on the brown stuff.  You tend to get more of what you focus on.  So choose to focus on the good stuff, and you’ll have no choice but to get more of it.               Gratitude feels good.  Gratitude may be the most empowering feeling you can have.  And it's always there, even when you think it isn't.  All you have to do is to choose to focus on what's good in your life.  In his moving book Man's Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl recounts how even in the midst of the unimaginable brutality of a Nazi concentration camp, he was able to find things to be grateful for: the companionship of his friends in camp; a moment of solitude; the savoring of a dry morsel of bread.  So when you’re feeling down, it can be helpful to remind yourself of how good you really do have it compared to what could be.              You can even feel gratitude for the relationship that you would like to have.  The fact is that the person with whom you'll be sharing this relationship is already out there somewhere, and it's only a matter of time before you meet or recognize him.  Think of it as a paycheck that you've already worked for and is coming to you sooner or later; you're sure it's coming, just not exactly when it's coming.  And you're okay with that.                When you feel gratitude, you feel good, and when you feel good, you glow.  Other people will gravitate towards you.  There is no more attractive force than being an epicenter of positive feeling.  So gratitude becomes the magnet that will draw the right person into your life.  As Tenzin Gyatso, the 13th Dalai Lama famously noted, "There is no way to happiness; happiness is the way."              Another neat feature of gratitude is that it tends to be its own reward.  Feelings don't come with little color-coded flags saying this is the name of what you are feeling.  For example, what you may think of as fear you could just as easily re-interpret as excitement or anticipation.  Similarly, gratitude feels a lot like fulfillment; in fact, it may be the essence of what fulfillment is.  So when you consciously choose to feel gratitude, you're bringing fulfillment into your life on demand.  And when you have that feeling of fulfillment and the empowerment that comes with it, you may no longer feel that you really need a man, since you already have the feelings that he would bring.  However, you may still want a man, which is a much more empowered position to operate from than needing one.  More on that later. The Be-Do-Have Paradigm              Most people are seeking some kind of result in life, and believe that success means having that result, be it wealth, status, relationships.  As such, they’re often looking for the shortcut, the quick and dirty solution, the overnight scheme.  Sure, there are overnight schemes; the problem is that they also tend to last only overnight.  Easy come, easy go.                True success, on the other hand, is not an accident; it is a habit.  Most lottery winners go back to their original or lower level of wealth just two years after winning all that money; many go bankrupt.  True success only comes from embarking on a path of mastery, which takes time and effort.  By purchasing this book and reading this far, you have taken the first and second steps on that path.  For that I congratulate you.  Seventy percent of people don’t even make it this far[*].  Keep up the good work.              Most people think of success in terms of possession: in order to be someone, you must have something.  If you have money and spend lots of it, you are rich.  If you have an attractive mate, you are successful in dating.                The truth is that the reverse of this mindset is the true key to success.  All great works of spirituality from the Tao Te Ching to the Bible emphasize that the first step of success is to embody the vision of the success you want to have: "As you believe, so it is done unto you."  A simple and powerful articulation of this is the Be-Do-Have paradigm, in which success comes from possessing the mindset, “I am a successful person.”  This in turn leads to actions.  The actions then manifest the signs that people commonly refer to as success.                There is a long-standing tradition in Eastern wisdom of being detached from results.  As Krishna said to Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita, you are entitled to your actions, not the results of your actions.  Here’s the insight: if you are following the path of fulfillment, then the action is the result.  The work is the wealth.  As Mahatma Gandhi put it, “Full effort is full victory.”                    Let’s use the example of money.  In order to be wealthy, first you must be a wealthy person, with the attendant mindsets and beliefs.  You wake up in the morning thinking, “How would Warren Buffett spend his day?”  Once you have convinced your brain that you are a wealthy person, then you will naturally do what a wealthy person does – do your homework, make good decisions, have shrewd associates, be thrifty in your ways, have overall welfare in mind.  And, as a result, not only will you  effortlessly have what a wealthy person possesses, but you will also have the true wealth of following a path of fulfillment.  This is true of any sphere of endeavor.   You rise to a higher level of consciousness by taking your attention away from your present limitations and placing it upon that which you desire to be.  Do not attempt this in day-dreaming or wishful thinking but in a positive manner.  Claim yourself to be the thing desired.  I AM that; no sacrifice, no diet, no human tricks.  All that is asked of you is to accept your desire.  If you dare claim it, you will express it.                – Neville, Your Faith Is Your Fortune               For example, Marie Curie was always the brilliant Nobel-winning scientist, even when she was a young, penniless nanny.  When she inhabited that 18-year old mind and body without access to knowledge of her future, she may have never imagined turning into one of the greatest scientists in history and the winner of two Nobel prizes.  Yet to us, it seems strange to think of her any other way than the Marie Curie, regardless of her age.  You can apply that example to the young versions of any great person in history.  The young Eleanor Roosevelt, Jane Austen, and Indira Gandhi all harbored self-doubt in their development towards greatness.  Yet, in retrospect, they were great to us even as young women on the journey.  Recognize that you are on that same journey of greatness, and that it takes a little bit of time for the greatness to fully manifest.              So now I invite you to envision the most brilliant vision of your future.  Where do you see yourself in 10 years?  In twenty?  What will you accomplish?  How do you want to be remembered?  What kind of relationships will you have?  With what kind of people?  Make that vision as grand as possible, and then start to embody it immediately.  Re-read the quote from Neville above.  Is there a guarantee that all the details of your vision will come true?  Perhaps not 100%.  But without the vision, there is hardly a chance of achieving the goal.                So dare to think and imagine.  No one has access to your thoughts, so make them as big and brilliant and inspiring as possible.  Great thoughts cost as much as mediocre ones, so might as well go big.  Now is a good time to do the following exercise. Exercise 2. Your highest vision of yourselfTake a deep breath and close your eyes.  Imagine yourself as a child, maybe 7 years old.  Remember then how badly you wanted to grow up, be tall, go places like the grownups, reach high shelves, drive a car.  Remember that feeling of inadequacy that you had then and how you just couldn’t wait for all this to happen.                Now bring a picture of your current adult self into the scene, and give your child self a big hug saying, “Hey, told you it was all going to be all right.”  Feel that deep compassion and acceptance.                Now imagine a third version of yourself – a version from the future that embodies all the accomplishments and goals you are seeking right now.  What does that person look like?  Really take the time to notice her voice, her gait, her demeanor.  How does she look and sound?  How does it feel to be her?  Now have that future you come in and give the present you a big hug, saying “It’s all going to be all right,” just the way you hugged the 7-year old you.                Now let the three pictures of you from the past, present and the future merge into one another, leaving an image of that highest vision of yourself, and realize that it is you, right now.  When you feel the empowering feelings that brings, squeeze your left fist twice.  From now on, all you have to do to bring that empowering feeling back is to repeat that double squeeze.                  In this chapter, we will break down the Be-Do-Have paradigm into four practical components: right beliefs, leading to right attitudes, leading to right behaviors, which naturally flow into right results.  The steps go from the more hidden to the more manifest.  Beliefs and attitudes are the be phase; attitudes and behaviors are the do phase; results are the have phase.                Beliefs are completely hidden, not even manifest to the trained eye.  Since your beliefs are yours to know alone, it makes sense to have the most effective beliefs possible, as grandiose or foolhardy as they may sound.  Strong, empowering beliefs cost as much as mediocre, ineffective ones: they’re all free![2]  So use the beliefs that serve you best.              An attitude is the first-level manifestation of a belief, hardly detectable even to a trained observer.  Sometimes it is expressed verbally or in body language; other times it manifests itself as the subtext of behavior.  People tend to respond not to your hidden thoughts or to your manifest behavior, but rather to your overall attitude.  Your attitude is the meta-message and meaning of your behavior.              Behavior is what you do, which is easy to observe.  The range of possible behaviors is infinite, yet most of us operate within a narrow envelope of behavior which those who know us call our personality.  When we do something that seems to breach that narrow envelope, they say that we are behaving ‘out of character.’  Behavioral range is determined by attitudes and beliefs.  It is possible to change attitudes and beliefs by regularly engaging in new behaviors consistent with those new beliefs.                 Results are the most manifest component of the process.  Results broadcast themselves just fine yet reveal little useful information regarding how to achieve them.  Knowing how much wealth someone has does not help you get rich like them; nor does seeing that someone has a wonderful companion tell you how that came about.  This may seem obvious, but most people find themselves motivated by observing the results and not the process by which they came into being.  So henceforth, in all spheres of life, wherever you observe success, look at the process.  That is where the true wealth resides.                 The soft overcomes the hard.              Flexibility overcomes force.              Keep your inner workings to yourself.              Let your results speak for themselves.                                          – Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching, Ch. 36 Affective forecasting, or what really happens when you get what you want              We humans are hypersocial beings, and companionship is an essential part of our experience.  But, come to think of it, you don't really need a man in your life.  Not the same way you need food, water, shelter, clothing, oxygen and Vitamin D; they are essential to your survival and health.  Now you may want a man, and that's okay (and in any case, men are much more flattered when they are wanted rather than needed).               However, a man is not a panacea.  If you're in a bad job situation, don't get along with your family, have financial troubles, or fundamentally aren't happy with yourself, a man in your life is not likely to solve those issues, no matter how fantastic he is.  A man can at best be a conduit and catalyst for feelings of fulfillment.  Keep in mind especially that all feelings that you have, you generate inside your head.  There is no wire from the outside world that plugs into the back of your head and makes you have feelings.  If there is one person in the world chiefly responsible for your feelings, it's you.                Daniel Gilbert of Harvard studies affective forecasting, our ability to predict how we will feel in the future in response to events.  What he has found is that, a few months down the road from the event, we don’t feel nearly as good as we thought we would about pleasant things, nor feel nearly as bad about negative ones.  In other words, we overestimate both our happiness and distress in response to future events.  A year after an event, we tend to return to the same baseline level of happiness we had before.                Finding a suitable male companion may be likened to winning the lottery.  Most women desirous of a relationship think they would be really happy if they started dating a wonderful man, in the same way that most people think they'd be really happy if they won a lottery.  The fact is, soon after winning a lottery, the winners tend to return to the baseline level of happiness they had before winning.  It's reasonable to conclude that the level of contentment and happiness you feel, after the initial whirlwind of excitement in a relationship has settled, is the same as the one you are experiencing right now in your seat while reading this passage.                There is a spiritual principle in operation here, reiterated in many guises in numerous traditions, but its essence is this: You have everything that you need. Right here, right now.  Now this may be challenging to grasp, as you wonder about unpaid bills, an empty fridge and all that extra room in your bed at night.  But at a deep and fundamental level, it is always true. At every point in your life leading to this moment, you have had everything that you needed (once gain, emphasizing need rather than want): a womb in which the cells of your body multiplied and grew, caregivers to raise you, a nervous system that was capable of learning language, movement and other complex tasks, and the inner resources to succeed at school, work and human relations.                However, let's leave alone the factual accuracy of whether or not you have everything that you need and play pretend for a moment: What if that were actually true?  How would that make you feel?  What kind of person would you be if you truly believed that you have everything that you need?  And what kind of people would you draw into your life if you were that person?  Start there.  In the chapter on beliefs, we will delve deeper into how beliefs empower you and bring you more of what you want.

Chapter 2. Who You Really Are                Right now, as you are sitting there, reading this sentence, a number of answers may come to mind to the question, "Who are you really?"  These answers may have to do with various aspects of your supposed identity: your age, for example.  Where you were raised.  Where you went to school.  Your employment.  Your preferences in clothing, food, leisure and travel.  Your endearing quirks.  That cute little dimple you get every time you smile.  Your vivacious spirit.                These are all aspects of who you are, but they are not you.  No single characteristic makes up who you are, and most of them are mutable in any case.  Jobs change, habits come and go, temperaments evolve.  So what is that stable, immutable part of you which will always be you, your self? The concept of no-self              Buddhist philosophy argues that there is no such thing as a fixed self.  Right now, you just took a breath, and trillions of oxygen molecules came from the outside and exchanged with the carbon dioxide in your blood.  Billions of blood cells moved around to nourish your body. You just read that last sentence, which means that millions of your neurons fired to see, process and make sense of these words on a page.  As a result, you are not exactly the same as you were five seconds ago – you have changed.  Perhaps not in a way obvious to the naked eye, but in a very real sense, you are different than you were a moment ago.              The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus once said that you never bathe in the same river twice, because it's never the same river and it's never the same you.  If you were to look at a river, close your eyes, and open them again a few seconds later, every water molecule will have moved, the banks will have rearranged themselves by a little bit, and it will effectively be a brand new river.                You, too, are like a river.  There is no fixed version of you.  There is no self.  The Buddhists call this concept anatta, or no-self.  In fact, they say that nothing in the world has a fixed self; everything is in flux.  Including you.              You may find this concept of no-self distressing: "Oh no!  I don't really exist!  What am I to do?"  Or you may find it a purely philosophical, not terribly practical exercise: "Well, clearly I'm here, so there is some kind of self.  What's your point?"                Let me offer another way to look at no-self: as a concept that can be both useful and liberating.  Since this book is about dating, let's think about it in a dating context.  What would happen if no-self were true?              Well, you wouldn't be afraid of rejection.  And you wouldn't be concerned about what others thought or said of you, since there is no you!  As a result, you would be willing to approach and speak to any man you fancied.  This would vastly increase the range of men you'd be able to date.                Since there's no fixed self to hurt, you'd be less afraid of getting hurt in a relationship and more focused on the enrichment you can derive from the connection.  When you do end up dating a man, you would be less likely to feel insulted or slighted by any of his actions, since you can't take any of it personally.  Your ego would not get in the way of a good connection.  And when the time comes to part, you'd be less likely to feel hurt, rejected or abandoned, since there's no self to be hurt, rejected or abandoned.                Suddenly, this no-self  idea seems really handy.  Is it really true?  Who knows.  Can it enrich your life?  Absolutely.                For better or for worse, the concept of no-self is easy to grasp but challenging to implement.  If we have conditioned ourselves for decades to have an ego and serve it, then we are probably not going to get rid of that tendency overnight.  Buddhist monks spend entire lifetimes meditating in monasteries to get to anatta.  Since that kind of commitment may exceed your available time and patience, here are some practical ways to bring more anatta into your life: 1) Meditation.  You don't have to spend years in a monastery to derive benefit from meditation.  As little as three 15-minute sessions a week is enough to start significant impact on your life.                This reminds me of an old Zen story about a student who comes to his teacher and asks earnestly, "O master, how can I achieve enlightenment?"  The teacher says, "Go in that room and meditate about a cow.  Just think about that cow with unwavering attention."              So the student goes in the room, and meditates.  He doesn't come out all day.  And then the next day.  And the next.  By the third day, the master gets worried, so he asks the student, "Aren't you going to come out?"              And the student replies, "I would, but my horns won't fit through the doorway."              You tend to get more of what you focus on, to the point that you may even become what you focus on.  So if you concentrate on the idea of no-self diligently, it's bound to take a hold on your consciousness.                Here's a meditation my students have found useful for getting the idea of no-self anchored in their minds.  An audio recording of this meditation is included with this book.  You can find it at www.taoofdating.com/goddess. Exercise 3. The Galactic Consciousness MeditationImagine that you have become very, very small.  You are so small that you are the size of a molecule of air.  Now imagine that you are in outer space, with nothing around you but the stars and the galaxies.  You see them all in their vastness, glory and beauty.  Some are so far away that they just look like a ring or disc in the distance.  Some are close, and you can appreciate that there are 100 billion stars in a given galaxy, all of different sizes, luminosities, shapes.  They are all beautiful, all incredibly vast, unimaginably full of light and energy.               In the corner of one such galaxy, you can discern a tiny blue marble.  You start to move towards it, and for a long, long time, there's hardly anything in your way – the occasional bit of cosmic dust, but otherwise the vacuum of space.  You get closer and start to discern features of the globe – oceans, continents, swirls of cloud.  Eventually, you get close enough to approach the Earth's atmosphere.  You encounter molecules of air –  just a few at a time at first, then more and more of them.  You zip past them, getting closer to the Earth's surface.  Gradually you are engulfed by molecules of air.  You are swimming in them.                As you approach the Earth's surface, you see a figure who has a striking resemblance to someone you know.  Actually it's you, and you get closer and closer to the surface of your own skin.  And as you pass through your own skin, you become aware that the density of molecules around you goes up.  Remember that you're the size of a single molecule, so as you travel through your own body, you notice its utter vastness – the billions of molecules that make up each cell, the trillions of cells that make up the whole organism.  It's as if the body itself is like a galaxy, these countless elements working together to create a living, magnificent being.                You spend some time inside your own body, and then exit out of it into the atmosphere again.  And then, you travel past the skin of another person, into another body that's just as vast, just as awe-inspiring as the last one.  You travel to another body, and another, and another, noticing all the ways in which they are similar to one another while maintaining their individuality, just like those galaxies you were looking at from outer space.  And now you're moving faster and faster, journeying through body after body, and you start to see each cell as a star inside that galaxy.  You travel through the bodies of animals, of plants, of every living being, and see them all as they truly are, as expressions of one essence, one truth.  As you do that, you eventually return to your own body, and expand and expand, until you inhabit it fully.  You are now that galaxy, and you now appreciate the vastness of you, and the kinship you have with everything else in the world.  Feel that kinship now, as you bow your head in reverence to your own magnificence, and the magnificence of all of creation.               Another simple technique I like is the hong-sau meditation.  Sit down with your back upright and your hands on your lap, palms upturned.  Now close your eyes and focus on the space between your eyebrows, the 'third-eye center'.  Now with each inhalation, say to yourself the sacred Sanskrit syllable hong; with each exhalation, silently say sau (pronounced like 'saw')[3].  All the while, maintain your concentration on the space between your eyebrows, or third-eye center.  You can make this your daily meditation practice, starting at 15 minutes a day and building from there. 2) Do yoga.  I think of yoga as a moving meditation.  The more vigorous the practice, the better.  Why?  Because you'll be so busy breathing, holding and balancing, you'll have little mental space left for such trivial matters as the ego.              Once again, the key is to have a regular practice.  The more you bathe yourself in this pond, the more of the old notion of self you'll wash away.  Practice at least twice a week if you want to see any appreciable results.  Three or more times a week and you will notice some serious progress.   3) Use the Reminder Technique.  You may have heard of the holy month of Ramadhan in Muslim cultures where everyone fasts for a month.  One of the requirements for your fast to be acceptable is to keep your thoughts and deeds pure in addition to refraining from eating and drinking.  That gnawing hunger you experience in the pit of your belly is a reminder to be a better kind of person all day long.  And the idea is that, after a whole month of that, you stand a real chance of behaving differently the other eleven months of the year, too.              You can do a similar version of that for the idea of no-self.  An elastic wristband, a ring, an ink mark on your right thumb – anything can serve as your reminder to live the concept of no-self during the day.  Use this reminder several weeks in a row, and the idea may just stick. 4) Experience flow.  Psychologist Mihaly Czikszentmihaly (pronounced 'cheeks sent me high') talks about flow – that optimal state in which the task is matched to the ability.  You're stretching yourself just a little bit, so the task is challenging (as opposed to boring) without being frustrating.                All of us have experienced flow at some point or another.  For a pianist, it could be the performance of a Brahms prelude.  For a rower, it could be that time when the whole crew works together as a unit and the boat 'swings'.  For a surfer, it could be paddling at just the right speed to catch and surf a perfect wave.                Whatever flow is, you've got to find it for you.  And start doing that thing more and more.  Why?  Because when you're in flow, you are the action.  Ego dissolves, and there is no more you – there is only do.  So think back to all those times when you were in flow, and seek out those activities again.  You may be surprised to find yourself revisiting something you haven't done in a long time which you still find strangely gratifying.   5) Travel.  Of all of the methods listed above, this may very well be the most potent.  Much of what you consider your fixed identity is anchored into your environment: your dwelling, your workplace, the streets you usually drive, the supermarket you usually shop at, the drink you usually order, the people you usually hang out with, the clothes you usually wear.              Remove all those hooks, and a new version of you (or no-you) has a chance to emerge.  The more removed the locale from your everyday experience, the more likely you are to let go of the fixed notion of self.                So go hang out with some Galapagos turtles, Peruvian shamans, African springboks, and Mongolian herdsmen.  Then write back and tell me how it went.                            There's one method that's guaranteed not to give you any results at all, and that's doing what you have been doing all along.  Nothing changes if nothing changes.  This book is about getting results by taking action.  No action, no results.  You've taken one big step towards getting results by purchasing this book and reading this far.  If you really want to test the idea of no-self and reap its benefits in your life, commit to doing at least two of the above steps now.  You'll be glad you did. Who you really are              We've talked about how you are not some static entity known as the self.  Let's say you agree with that.  So what are you then?              We've got a lot of options here, so let's try this one on for size: you are a conduit for abundance in the universe.  To say that you are a conduit means that abundance is already present in the universe; you are merely the instrument it passes through.  Since you are the conduit, you do not get to own any of the abundance; you are just the pipeline.              Expanding on that idea, you are also a conduit for right action, or te.  Te is the implementation aspect of the Tao.  Taoism is far from being a passive philosophy. It is about taking right action so in consonance with the Tao, so in tune with the natural way of things, that it seems effortless, the way water flows downstream.  When you become one with the flow of the Tao, your actions take on a lightness, grace and effectiveness that they wouldn't have when they were emanating from the ego.  You abolish struggle.              Another idea to ponder has roots in every ancient spiritual system.  In the Hindu tradition, it is called advaita, which is Sanskrit for non-duality.  It simply means that there is a ground of being, a basic essence from which all beings in the universe arise.  Plainly stated, it is about how we are all cut from the same fabric.                Rationally, this is easy to grasp: we're all made of the same molecules and atoms that make up the rest of the universe.  The chair you're sitting on, the air you're breathing, the clothes you're wearing are all made of the same molecules of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, etc.  By extension, you can imagine that there is also a spiritual essence that makes up all beings and the whole of the universe.  And you are made of that.                If this seems like an abstract concept to you right now, don't worry.  Monks spend years meditating on this so they can fully grasp their oneness with the universe at a visceral level.  As long as you are interested in grasping this concept and applying it to your life, you will.                Perhaps some day you'll start a regular meditation practice (if you don't already have one) and really feel the meaning of advaita in your bones.  In the meantime, the passage below from an ancient Hindu text is one of the best I have encountered in explaining how all beings are made of the same essence.  In it, King Aruni is explaining the concept of non-duality to his son Svetaketu, who has just returned from his long studies: The bees, my dear son, prepare honey by gathering the nectar of different trees and reducing that nectar to a unity.  So that the nectar from each different tree is not able to differentiate: "I am the nectar of this tree" and "I am the nectar of that tree."  In exactly the same way, my son, when all creatures merge into reality, they are not aware that "We are merging into reality."  No matter what they are in this world – whether they are a tiger, a lion, a wolf, a boar, a worm, a moth, a gnat, or a mosquito – they all merge into that reality.  That finest essence here is the self of the whole world.  That is reality; that is the self.  And thou art that.                            – Chandogya Upanishad, translated by R. Hume, p. 264 Embracing The Goddess              Western society has a pervasive habit of self-diminishment.  As children, we are told that pride is the deadliest of the seven mortal sins.  Hubris brought Achilles down, and if we're not careful, it will surely bring us down, too.  Thus, many of us spend our lives overcompensating for this fear of egotism.  We politely deflect compliments, try our best not to seem too smart, too pretty, too stylish.  We compete in self-deprecation contests to see who can put herself down the most.              Now I'm not quite sure how you benefit from hiding your light under a bushel.  How does playing small and feeling small enrich the world around you?  In fact, diminishing your gifts is a selfish act since you're depriving all those around you of your light.  And as a woman, the world needs your light now more than ever.                There is no more eloquent expression of this idea than in Marianne Williamson's Return to Love: Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our greatest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, fabulous, gorgeous, talented? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world. There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that's within us. It's not just in some of us. It's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we automatically give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fears, our presence automatically liberates others.               So I would like to propose an alternative to this regime of self-diminishment: the embracing of the Goddess within.  In many Eastern spiritual traditions, especially the various forms of Tantra, we are all manifestations of divine energy.  Thus, as a woman, you are the incarnation of the divine in female human form.                At some point before, you may have heard the idea that you contain the Goddess within you.  You may have even found it interesting and appealing if somewhat abstract, not certain how it would apply to your life.                I'd like to bring to your attention that, far from being an abstraction, the idea of embodying the Goddess is an eminently practical one, with immediate, life-changing consequences.  Because Goddess status is not something that you apply for or wait to receive when you are worthy.  The Goddess is already within you, waiting to emerge.  You just have to let it.  In her excellent book A Woman's Worth (which I highly recommend if you haven't read it already), Williamson says: We think of ourselves as flesh and bone, resumes and relationships, clothes and cosmetics.  The truth of who we are, why we're here and where we're going is far more spectacular than any of these worldly things indicate.  We are God's precious vessels and we are always pregnant with his possibilities.               The way to allow the Goddess to emerge is simple: act as if you already are her.  If the Goddess represents infinite kindness, then you act with infinite kindness.  If the Goddess is grace, then you behave graciously.  If the Goddess is nurturance, then you nurture those around you.  If the Goddess is strength, then you are strong and give strength to those around you.  If the Goddess is radiance, then you shine your light wherever you go.   Exercise 4.  Embodying the GoddessWhat does the word goddess mean to you?  Take a few minutes to write down what comes to your mind as you complete this sentence: "To be the Goddess is to be the embodiment of ..." Here are some ideas to get you started: wisdom, beauty, grace, joy, sensuality, nurturance, passion, kindness, forgiveness, strength, radiance.              Now that you have your list, take a moment to imagine what it would be like if you were to embody those characteristics.  What would you look like?  How would you move differently?  What would it feel like in your body?  Imagine a few situations you were in this week, and notice how you would handle them differently if you were embodying the Goddess.  What would you say?  How would you act?  Imagine some scenarios in the future – at home, at work, or in a social setting.  What do you notice about yourself?                Finally, imagine yourself interacting with a man you're interested in – perhaps a former or future companion.  What is the quality of the connection?  How does the relationship unfold differently from before?                If you are not yet completely comfortable with the idea that you are the Goddess, that's okay.  Do the exercise anyway.  Do it again.  And again.  Eventually, it will feel right.  And sooner than you think, it takes hold in your consciousness.                This is not about egotism.  It's not about being better than anyone else.  It's simply about exercising the choice to become who you already are.  Once again in A Woman's Worth, Williamson says: "At every moment, a woman makes a choice: between the state of the queen and the state of the slavegirl."  Embodying your true power as Queen and Goddess is a choice – one you can make right now.                When you are the queen, the Goddess, then the right kind of men – the Warriors, the Kings – will naturally gravitate towards you.  The slavegirl will also attract men, but she's much more likely to attract the wrong kind.  When you flourish into the most glorious, radiant, version of you, people will take notice – especially the good men.  But that is merely a side benefit.  Much more important is that you will feel alive and empowered, which is its own reward: When a woman has owned her passionate nature, allowing love to flood her heart, her thoughts grow wild and fierce and beautiful... When a woman conceives her true self, a miracle occurs and life around her begins again. – Marianne Williamson, A Woman's Worth Your shortcut to divinity              If I were to pick one and only one quality that would bring out your goddess nature and make you irresistible to men, it would have to be radiance.  It encompasses earthly aspects: radiant health, glowing skin, radiant smile.  It encompasses metaphysical aspects as well: radiating positive energy, shining the light of the divine.              That's nice, you say, but how do you do that?  Well, if I told you that doing one simple practice would make you irresistibly radiant to almost any man, and remove every woman as competition, would you do it?  Think about that for a second.              What if I told you that this practice would require all of your courage and a complete re-thinking of who you are?  Would you still do it?                The practice is simple, and it encompasses nearly everything we discussed in Exercise 4.  It is called devotion (which may mean something different than what you think).  If you are able to convey complete and utter devotion to a man, he will feel so energized, so elevated, so manly that he will have absolutely nowhere to go but to you.  You will be irresistible.  We will discuss devotion and how to practice it in an empowering context in Chapter 10 when we talk about attraction.
