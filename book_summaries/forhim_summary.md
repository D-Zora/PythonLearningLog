- [1. For example, she may say, “I had fun the first couple of dates, and I really like you, but I can’t be with a guy who... (fill in some behavior you don’t like).” She says this instead of complaining, “Why don’t you ever...” That’s the take-it-or-leave-it mentality she holds dearly.](#key-idea-1)
- [2. There’s nothing more frustrating to a guy than getting cozy with a woman, starting to make out, hoping that it will happen, seeing her get all steamy and hot herself, having her remove his shirt or her blouse or whatever other sign that makes it clear that the birds are about to start chirping, only to have the woman then say, “Stop.](#key-idea-2)

## 🔹 Key idea 1 of 6 <a name='key-idea-1'></a>

### ✨ For example, she may say, “I had fun the first couple of dates, and I really like you, but I can’t be with a guy who... (fill in some behavior you don’t like).” She says this instead of complaining, “Why don’t you ever...” That’s the take-it-or-leave-it mentality she holds dearly.


Being kind is crucial here. She never behaves like a bitch. She’s kind but firm and strict. She brings her best self to the table and expects the same from her guy. When he fails to deliver, she’ll let him know right away. For example, she may say, “I had fun the first couple of dates, and I really like you, but I can’t be with a guy who... (fill in some behavior you don’t like).” She says this instead of complaining, “Why don’t you ever...” That’s the take-it-or-leave-it mentality she holds dearly.

-        Men have a huge drive to make babies. Not to be a daddy, change diapers, play happy family. They merely want to have sex and make babies. It’s in their instincts. They want to spread their genes and reproduce. They have been programmed to. For this, men do not, I repeat, do not think about sex all the time! Yet, a lot of what they do is to get sex indeed!

-        Here’s another trick you can use. I’ll never forget when I was about 14 years old, full on in my puberty and hornier than a bull. I had a young and pretty math teacher. She was always well dressed and took care of her appearance. One day she had been sitting at her desk as we completed an assignment. She was wearing a classy skirt and shirt, with her hair in a ponytail. Then she dropped a pen and bent over to pick it up. For a split second I could look up her shirt that was loosely hanging down. I saw her bra. This drove me nuts. My hormones went berserk for the very first time ever. This was also the very first time I had felt one of the powers a woman can have over a guy. She gave me a hint. My mind couldn’t stop thinking about the complete picture. Had she given me the complete picture by standing totally naked in front of the blackboard, I would not have been thinking about her in that way for months. To be honest, even thinking about that moment now, more than twenty years later, still does something to me. There are many ways you can give him a hint. However, it should be inconspicuous. If he realizes you’re doing it on purpose, it will lose ALL of its power. All of it! It devalues you right away to the one-night-stand category. Trying (too) hard never works well on a man. Please remember they always want what they cannot get (right away) or that for which they have to work hard.

### ✨ There’s nothing more frustrating to a guy than getting cozy with a woman, starting to make out, hoping that it will happen, seeing her get all steamy and hot herself, having her remove his shirt or her blouse or whatever other sign that makes it clear that the birds are about to start chirping, only to have the woman then say, “Stop.


There’s nothing more powerful than being in a relationship with a guy and having him do exactly what you want while he thinks it was his idea. (This is important, as you’ll see. He needs to think he is the one in the driver’s seat, even though you actually are.)

2. She tries to impress him when it should be the other way around. The nice girl often has a deeply engrained belief that she is not enough. So she must compensate by being nice or overly supportive and kind. There’s no faster way to devalue yourself than by trying to impress him. This action, by definition, proves to him that you believe you’re beneath him. A man should always look up to his woman; he should never look down on her.

When he says he’ll call and then doesn’t, some women who finally do get a hold of him will snap at him. When you read between the lines, you’ll notice this woman is clearly communicating he’s very important to her, she has been worrying about when she’d finally get through to him, and now, she’s mad. There’s no challenge for him as a result. He has her. This will reassure and scare him at the same time. And that last part is important. Some men test a woman just to see where they stand. But even when they get the confirmation, they’ll get scared. Did I already mention that men are totally illogical when it comes to emotions and romance?

### ✨ Because if and when you do, you’ve just proven to them you don’t sleep around, that it will be a challenge to share the bed sheets with you, and that it will eventually be an honor when you decide they are good enough to get you.


This can very well be a test! They want to see how quickly you will bend over...figuratively. They want you to say no. Because if and when you do, you’ve just proven to them you don’t sleep around, that it will be a challenge to share the bed sheets with you, and that it will eventually be an honor when you decide they are good enough to get you.

Because she found other interests she was passionate about, he wanted to ditch his friends and spend time with her.

This system, a Ponzi scheme, works great...until it no longer does. Then it falls down like a house of cards. Mr. Fraud can live a lavish lifestyle and swim in money. But since he never invested any of the money, he’s losing money from the start. He can only keep paying people back as long as new people keep investing (since he always uses that money to pay back earlier investors). When the market crashes, or when anything happens in the world that makes new investors hold on to their money or worse, people ask for their money back, his system fails. This will always happen at some point, of course. Mr. Fraud is then sent to jail. I never got this. Ponzi schemes always fail eventually. So why do so many people try to set them up? Because they are addicted to money and the power it brings.

## 🔹 Key idea 4 of 6 <a name='key-idea-4'></a>

### ✨ I think you will agree when I say that the guy who deserves to be in a long-term relationship with you should be someone who doesn’t take you for granted, who fought for you, and who gladly has put in the time and effort required to get you.


Let me start off by explaining I am in no way talking about the sexual act. Fuck him in this case is not physical, it’s mental.

And yet, every woman I’ve ever met tries to not be needy or wear her heart on her sleeve. She simply wants to protect her feelings. Nevertheless, most women I’ve coached have had men seem very interested only to disappear suddenly. These women are left standing in the dark. Once the guy vanishes, they often find out it’s easier to get the President of the United States on the phone than the man who seemingly really liked them...just not enough to stick around.

I, as a dating coach and author of books for women who want to get men, cannot take it anymore. You deserve better. This is not your fault. It’s his! He needs to learn to be much more transparent and upfront. That said, we both know most men won’t change. We can lead a horse to water, but we can’t make it drink. Or can we? What if there was a way to change a guy’s behavior? What if you could get into his head and take over the driver’s wheel? What if you could make him do more of the things that you appreciate and need and less of the bad behaviors you dislike? At first, this might seem impossible. Nevertheless, I’m sure you’ve already met women who are good at manipulating their men.

## 🔹 Key idea 5 of 6 <a name='key-idea-5'></a>

### ✨ If he breaks up with you or rejects you and you keep handing yourself over on a silver platter, thus making it super easy to get you, you are forcing him to realize he can get better than you (even if he really can’t and is the dumbest idiot alive).


You’ll see behavior you’ve never seen from him. He’ll start to put in an effort that makes you feel like you’re a queen because to him, you are. At first, it will be strange. If you’ve never truly been in control of a man, it might feel like riding a horse for the first time. But soon, it will make you feel all tingly inside.

Remember, your actions define how valuable he thinks you are. If you continuously try to give him everything he (might) want, there’s nothing left to chase. He will have to go looking for that chase somewhere else.

If he’s not a gentleman, he’ll run as fast as he can.  If he is a gentleman, he’ll try to hold on a little longer but will eventually leave as well.

### ✨ Somewhere in his pyramid you’ll find, “find a good woman who adores me.” When that need has been met, he goes on to a higher layer of the pyramid like “What seats should I get for the Sunday football game?” or “How can I get a promotion?” or “John and I should really go out for drinks to catch up.” He can worry about these because a more basic need, find a good woman who adores me, has been met.


Men have this hierarchy of needs as well. Somewhere in his pyramid you’ll find, “find a good woman who adores me.” When that need has been met, he goes on to a higher layer of the pyramid like “What seats should I get for the Sunday football game?” or “How can I get a promotion?” or “John and I should really go out for drinks to catch up.” He can worry about these because a more basic need, find a good woman who adores me, has been met. As long as he feels sure and secure about this need, he moves on to more specialized needs.
