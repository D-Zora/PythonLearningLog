## Introduction

John thinks back to the early years of their marriage and recalls how actively he would build a grudge—like building a chair, you have to cut the rough materials of your life down to fit it, bang it together, shape it, and sit on it. The principle behind trust is, “I’ve got your back, and you’ve got mine.” So when your partner responds to this question today, do everything in your power to say yes, and make it happen, whether it’s “I need a break from the kids” or “I’d love to have lunch with you.” Extra Credit: Pick Up the Pennies Today, think of every potential moment of connection—even the most fleeting—as possible money in the bank. When your partner makes a bid but you can’t engage: Say, “I’d really love to hear about this, but I have to ______ (send this email, get the kids to bed, and so on); can you remember to tell me about it later?” You acknowledge that you want to do the turning toward, but circumstances prevent it.

Love. It’s a big word—hard to define and pin down. For centuries, the poets have been trying. It’s like a red, red rose (Burns). Or it is an ever-fixed mark, that looks on tempests and is never shaken (Shakespeare). It’s a many-splendored thing (says one classic romantic movie); it’s never having to say you’re sorry (according to another). Can something so huge, so essential, so mysterious, so individual—have a formula? Is there a “prescription” for love?

We should know: For the past fifty years, we’ve been putting love under the microscope, starting with John’s earliest research on marital interactions at Indiana University and spanning to today, as we still work closely with couples through the Gottman Institute. When we founded the Love Lab in Seattle in 1990, we wanted to know: What makes love last? Why does one couple stay together forever, while another falls apart? And was it even possible to quantify any of this with data—to use the tools of science and mathematical modeling to predict whether a couple would live happily ever after?

One of the first things that John discovered in the Love Lab was that we’re often wrong about what makes love last. By tracking his theories and results over time, he found that 60 percent of his earliest ideas about what makes marriages succeed or fail were off base. Like the rest of us, he’d spawned those ideas from cultural stereotypes—our favorite novels, TV shows and movies, our own families and experiences. These all have the capacity to lead us astray, and often do. That’s why we really need data. Analyzing data can accurately reveal what’s true and not true about what helps relationships succeed. Fortunately, even with that dismal early record of poor predictions, John didn’t quit. With his best friend, Dr. Robert Levenson, and his wife, Dr. Julie Schwartz Gottman, he dedicated his career to collecting and analyzing data to discover truths. The results? There is a science of love. And best of all, we now know clear ways to help a relationship. Love is—after all this time—no longer such a mystery.

The surprising thing is, it’s not about grand gestures. It’s not a Valentine’s Day bouquet or a last-minute trip to Paris. It’s not John Cusack standing outside your bedroom window with a boom box. Instead, it’s all about little things done often. You’ve heard the expression “The devil is in the details”? Well, in relationships, the love is in the details. They’re easy to do, but too often forgotten. We’ve all heard the phrase “Don’t sweat the small stuff.” It might be good life advice, but when it comes to love, it’s 100 percent wrong. Love is all about the small stuff. And it’s time to sweat.

Mark and Annette had decided to separate. It wasn’t an easy decision—they’d been married for more than a decade and had an eight-year-old daughter. But something was definitely off, and it had been for a long time. There had been a slow waning of attraction, interest, companionship. Their marriage had become dull and stale. They didn’t look forward to seeing each other at the end of the day as they once had; somehow, most of their interactions now ended with tension or sniping, not sweetness. At best, they felt like business partners or roommates, not lovers or friends.

As a last-ditch effort, Mark suggested going to a therapist. They hadn’t tried this before. But Annette figured, why not? They didn’t have anything to lose.

## Key Idea 5: We didn’t go there for every date—sometimes our dates were as simple as sitting on the front stoop of our house with a glass of wine or tea, watching the walkers and cyclists and cars pass through the neighborhood in the evening, talking about the events of the day, the things we had read or thought about, or the future.

And was it even possible to quantify any of this with data—to use the tools of science and mathematical modeling to predict whether a couple would live happily ever after?

Since then, we’ve brought all kinds of couples—married and unmarried, gay and straight, couples with kids and those without, newlyweds and married-for-decades seasoned pros—into the lab to drill down to the key factors that make a good relationship good. We’ve looked at every facet of their relationships—their body language, the way they converse, the way they fight, their personal histories and their love stories; we’ve watched their heart rates rise and fall and measured the flood of stress hormones in their bodies. We’ve filmed their every movement and reviewed the footage down to the hundredth of a second. Every scrap of data that could be gathered, we collected. We lifted the lid on love and took out all the little parts to determine what, precisely, made it tick. Like the Hadron Collider smashing apart an atom, we wanted to see if we could isolate the building blocks of love.

While group 1 was doing the friendship day, group 2 the conflict day, and group 3 both, the control group didn’t participate in any workshops at all. All they got was our book, The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work, and access to seven hours with a licensed therapist by phone. Surprisingly, none of the couples in the control group ever accessed the therapist. They only used the book. And, surprise, surprise, they did remarkably well! By simply reading the book, they made significant positive changes to their relationships, and they stayed changed a year later when we circled back to them. While the most successful group was still the group that did both days of the workshop, the book readers came in a close second—they did better than any of the other remaining groups in the study. Their marriages improved, and stayed that way one year later—just from using a book together.

Encourage your partner to say more. Make exploratory statements. Express interest and curiosity. You don’t have to have a response to everything, and you don’t have to solve their problems. In fact, try to resist problem-solving. That’s a different kind of conversation and isn’t the goal today. Making love maps is about listening, learning something new about the person you love, being surprised. If you feel the instinct to jump into problem-solving mode, or rebut something they’re saying, just mentally set it aside. Tell yourself: Not now—you can talk about that later.
