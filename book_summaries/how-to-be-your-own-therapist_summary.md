## Introduction

‘You seem like a normal guy for a therapist.’ ‘It wasn’t as weird as I expected.’ ‘I’m surprised we laughed.’ ‘It wasn’t all, “How did that make you feel?”’ ‘You didn’t seem shocked by what I said.’ ‘You didn’t hypnotise me.’ ‘I thought you would just nod your head and say, “I understand.”’ ‘It made more sense than I expected.’ ‘It wasn’t all tears and feelings.’ ‘I was expecting you to be a tw*t.’ (And variations on that theme.) Safety and security: Either a belief that you are safe, or a belief that you are not safe Lovability: Either a belief that you are lovable, or a belief that you are not lovable Self-worth: Either a belief that you have value, or a belief that you do not have value Hope: Either feeling hopeful, or feeling hopeless

I think we have too many people telling us to do more, be more and buy more, instead of helping us understand how we can live our present lives better and with less struggle. My other bugbear is how often we’re told to ignore the warning signs that life is getting on top of us. It’s all well and good being told, ‘You’ve got this!’ but sometimes we haven’t, and we might need a helping hand along the way.

When I first went to therapy in my early twenties, I thought I was pretty ‘sorted’. It might even have appeared that way to those around me. I was about to come out as gay and I thought talking to someone beforehand seemed like a sensible idea. In the first session, I started to tell my story to the therapist in a very mechanical, rehearsed way. It was all fine. I was fine. My life was fine. My family were fine. Everything was fine, fine, fine! The therapist paused and very calmly, said to me, ‘You tell me you’re fine, but you look a little sad.’ And that was the end of being fine. I suddenly found myself crying and we started the session again. Of course, I wasn’t fine, and it was time to stop pretending. Not only was this a relief but it was also the beginning of a new understanding of myself that I would never have discovered alone. Who would have thought Mr Fine had got it so wrong for so many years?

In my experience, much of the damage normally occurs at home. My intention here is not to blame parents or families, simply to offer the truth as I see it. Many families operate from dysfunctional foundations. They don’t intend to cause harm, but they do. You know the script: ‘Why can’t you be more like your brother?’, ‘Stop whining and leave me alone’ or ‘You’re lazy, selfish and ungrateful.’

## Key Idea 2: Working between sessions A series of actions, not just words, e.g. changes in behaviour Creating a new model of self-care that teaches you to look after yourself Committing to the process as an ongoing way of life Working with the connections between mind–body emotions A willingness to be challenged A willingness to let go of old patterns Not expecting the therapist to do all the work A willingness to be curious and open to a process full of possibilities A willingness to change

## Key Idea 4: It could translate to, ‘What snowflake wizardry is this man talking about?’ That’s when I started phrasing the question differently: ‘Do you give yourself a hard time?’ To that question I’d almost always get a resounding ‘Yes.’ I started following that question up with another: ‘Do you think life would be easier if you did less of that?’ Again, invariably a resounding ‘Yes.’ This is the point at which I now suggest we talk about self-compassion.

I’m a therapist and, like most therapists, I’ve been to therapy. It changed my life. In fact, therapy affected me so profoundly that I was inspired to become a therapist myself.

I believe therapy has the potential to change everyone’s lives for the better. But here’s the problem. It isn’t cheap, it’s hard to access and there are often waiting lists spanning years. And let’s not forget, there’s still some degree of stigma attached to therapy! But if you’re feeling at all hesitant, consider this: sometimes our brains need a little maintenance and looking after to help us deal with life’s challenges. And that’s what good therapy helps with. It’s nothing weird or freaky. I promise that you won’t end up living in a forest or hiding away in a cave. Therapy is for the courageous and what it delivers is true strength and endless possibilities for a fuller life.

One final declaration that might come as a bit of a surprise. I am not going to change you. I am offering you my insights, learning and experience. It is your choice what you do with it. Too many books, ‘gurus’ and professionals promise to change your life. I can’t do that. But I do believe you can change your life.

## Key Idea 5: It means asking yourself the question, ‘What do you need?’ Self-compassion means you instinctively learn when to leap into action and when to stop, when to advocate for yourself and when to protect yourself, e.g. ‘Let’s take a break,’ ‘I’m taking you away for a holiday,’ ‘I want you to see less of these people’ or ‘Let’s go out for a walk and switch off for a while.’ If I were forced to choose just one tool as a therapist, it would be self-compassion.

## Key Idea 6: Event: write down an account of what happened, attempting to stay objective and as close to the facts as possible Interpretation: write down how you’ve interpreted what happened, or what you’ve come away from the event believing Consequences: write down what impact your interpretation of the events is having on your thoughts, your emotions, your wellbeing and your ability to fall asleep right now, in this moment Closure: write down the thinking traps you’ve identified that you’re falling into, write down the evidence to support your negative thought patterns, write down the helpful alternative thought you’re replacing the unhelpful thought with, and, finally let go of the negative thought
