## 🔹 Key idea 1 of 6 <a name='key-idea-1'></a>

### ✨ Or, you are reading something and you get to the bottom of the page and you think to yourself, “What have I just read?” The reason this happens is because you never brought the information to life.


Have you ever had this experience? You are in an exam, and you know exactly what page the information is on but you don’t know what is on the page. Or, you are reading something and you get to the bottom of the page and you think to yourself, “What have I just read?” The reason this happens is because you never brought the information to life.

We remember nouns and adjectives with ease because they have meaning and we can make a mental picture without much effort. Most abstract words can be made to mean something. Just use a meaningful thought or word to represent a ‘meaningless’ word. Find a word or phrase that sounds the same or similar to the abstract word, or you can break a word up into its individual sounds. Imagine you had to remember the name Washington; you could turn that word into a picture of you washing a tin. Or, if you had to remember the word Hydrogen you could see a picture of a fire Hydrant drinking gin.

The next place is your mouth. Imagine big bright colorful numbers flying out of your mouth (Numerical intelligence). Or, you can only speak in numbers.

## 🔹 Key idea 2 of 6 <a name='key-idea-2'></a>

### ✨ Success To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.


Successful people believe that what they do is important and worth doing. With this belief, people move from interest into commitment. Consider living without your memory for one week. You wouldn’t be capable of doing anything. Everything you do, say, and understand is due to memory. It is your most important mental function and if you improve it, you will improve your life.

“Success is neither magical nor mysterious. Success is a natural consequence of consistently applying basic fundamentals.”

In this section we will be using a quote called Success that has been attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson. The first element of this memory method is to find the key words that will help you remember the rest of the text. Have a look at the key words that I have picked out:

## 🔹 Key idea 3 of 6 <a name='key-idea-3'></a>

### ✨ If you choose, you can continue to connect the rest of the information to the leaves, thorns, and the fruit or to a park where the tree is planted.


Imagine if you were born without a memory. Who would you be? You would be nothing; if you don’t have a memory, you don’t have anything else. If I ask you, “Who are you?” you would immediately start rearranging memories in your mind to answer that question. Your memory is the glue that binds your life together; everything you are today is because of your amazing memory. You are a data collecting being, and your memory is where your life is lived. If you didn’t have a memory, you wouldn’t be able to learn, think, have intelligence, create, or even know how to tie your shoes. You wouldn’t be able to build experience in any field because experience is just a collection of memories after all! Only if you can remember information can you live it.

Some people say you don’t need a good memory in the Google age. Ken Jennings said, “When you make a decision, you need facts. If those facts are in your brain, they’re at your fingertips. If they’re all in Google somewhere, you may not make the right decision on the spur of the moment.”

Which raises the question: would or have you hired a person for his or her ability to Google information? No, you want people with information and experience at their fingertips. You want confident people, people that are certain about what they know. Not storing information in your mind is expensive and can lead to embarrassment and poor judgment. If you have to continually refer to notes or manuals to do your work, you will waste time and look unprofessional. Would you rather buy a product from someone that forgets your name or from someone that remembers it? Would you allow a doctor to operate on you if she had to continually refer to a manual or an iPad? Definitely not!

## 🔹 Key idea 4 of 6 <a name='key-idea-4'></a>

### ✨ Have you ever had this experience, you are sitting in your room and you think, “I’m going to make chicken for dinner.” You then walk to the kitchen and when you get there you think, “What am I doing here?” You may even open the refrigerator door, thinking the refrigerator will provide you with your answer.


We fill our minds up with all kinds of conflict, and this takes us away from the moment. Have you ever had a fight with someone at home, then you get to work, and the whole day you can’t concentrate? Conflict pulls your mind in many directions; when you fill your mind with conflict, your mind will be all over the place. Conflict is the opposite of concentration.

Purpose: Have a clear purpose because clarity dissolves resistance. Always remember why you are reading or learning the information. Keep your purpose at the forefront of your mind. If you don’t know what you want, how are you going to know when you get it? Learning with a purpose increases your attention, comprehension, retention, and organizes your thoughts. The more specific the purpose, the more information you will get. A vague purpose would be: I want to learn more about memory from this book. A specific purpose would be: I want to learn at least six key strategies that will enable me to improve my memory. Focus on getting information that you can use – and then put it into practice. As David Allen said, “If you’re not sure why you’re doing something, you can never do enough of it.”

Have you ever had this experience? You are in an exam, and you know exactly what page the information is on but you don’t know what is on the page. Or, you are reading something and you get to the bottom of the page and you think to yourself, “What have I just read?” The reason this happens is because you never brought the information to life.

Here is the average person’s daily attention training: they wake up in the morning, not peacefully, usually to some loud song or blaring alarm clock. They check their mobile phone for any messages, just to see if anyone missed them. Then they jump out of bed into the shower and there they think about a hundred and ten things that they need to worry about or need to do. Unfortunately, they haven’t allowed themselves enough time to get ready and can only manage a small unhealthy breakfast and fill up with coffee. They get in their car, put the radio on, make phone calls, or even try to text messages in the traffic. They get all angry, and they get all worked up about the traffic. The traffic is there and won’t change; yet, they think it should change. In fact, we worry and focus our attention on a ‘million’ things which can all wait for the appropriate time, but we allow our attention to be pulled in different directions.

We can use other cars to remember other new information too. Here is a picture of a car with seven images on it. It shouldn’t conflict with the food car, because it opens up a new ‘memory file’.

The next storage compartment is your thighs. Here we will store Social intelligence. Imagine people having a big Party (Social) on your thighs. Really SEE the party and feel it happening on your thighs now.

Stop overwhelming yourself by continually changing the channels of your mind. Sharpen up your intellect by returning to the habit of doing one thing at a time. Rediscover the value of consecutive tasking, instead of settling for the quality dilution associated with simultaneous tasking. Exceptional work is always associated with periods of deep concentration. Nothing excellent ever comes from a scattered effort. When you are all there, your brain power and resources will be all there, too.
