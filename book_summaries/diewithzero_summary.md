## üîπ Key idea 1 of 6 <a name='key-idea-1'></a>

### ‚ú® If the $70,000 job costs you more in terms of your life energy‚Äîthe cost in time of a long commute to the city, the cost of the kinds of clothes you need for this high-status job, and of course the extra hours you have to put into the job itself‚Äîthen the person making the higher salary often comes out poorer in the end.


I believe everybody wants that kind of life‚Äîbut, realistically, not all of us can get it. And just to be up front: If you‚Äôre struggling to make ends meet, you might get some value out of this book, but not nearly as much as someone with enough money, health, and free time to make real choices about how to put those resources to the greatest use.

Of course, it‚Äôs more complicated than just knowing what makes you happy and spending your money on those experiences at every moment. That‚Äôs because our ability to enjoy different kinds of experiences changes throughout our lifetimes. Think about it: If your parents took you along on a tour of Italy when you were a toddler, how much did you get out of that expensive vacation, besides maybe a lifelong love of gelato? Or consider the other extreme: How much do you think you‚Äôll enjoy climbing Rome‚Äôs Spanish Steps when you‚Äôre in your nineties‚Äîassuming you‚Äôll still be alive and able to climb them at all by then? As the title of one economics journal article put it, ‚ÄúWhat Good Is Wealth Without Health?‚Äù

Several other ideas from that book stayed with me, but I‚Äôll just share the one most relevant to the pages you‚Äôre reading right now: A higher salary doesn‚Äôt always mean more actual income on an hourly basis. For example, a person making $40,000 per year might actually be making more per hour than someone earning $70,000 per year. How is that possible? Again, it‚Äôs all about life energy. If the $70,000 job costs you more in terms of your life energy‚Äîthe cost in time of a long commute to the city, the cost of the kinds of clothes you need for this high-status job, and of course the extra hours you have to put into the job itself‚Äîthen the person making the higher salary often comes out poorer in the end. This supposedly high earner also has less time left to enjoy the money he or she is earning. So when you‚Äôre comparing jobs, you really have to factor in those hidden but essential costs.

### ‚ú® We always have to balance living in the present with planning for the future, and the balance tilts gradually as you shift your death date out: The closer your death date is, the more urgency you need to have, and the further away it is, the more you can and should plan for the future.


That‚Äôs the theme of my whole book right there. We know what happens to the grasshopper‚Äîthe grasshopper starves‚Äîbut what happens to the ant? That is, if the ant spends his short life slaving away, when does he get to have any fun? We all have to survive, but we all want to do much more than survive: We want to really live.

In October of 2008, Erin and her husband, John, were successful lawyers with three young children when they learned that John had clear-cell sarcoma, a rare and rapidly growing cancer of the body‚Äôs soft tissues. ‚ÄúNobody thought that a healthy 35-year-old would have a tumor the size of a baseball,‚Äù Erin recalls. So no one suspected cancer until the tumor had spread to John‚Äôs back and leg bones. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt understand how serious his condition was until he had an X-ray and it was lit up like a Christmas tree,‚Äù Erin says. The grim diagnosis terrified and overwhelmed her. And with John too sick to work, the full burden of taking care of the family physically and financially fell to her. It was too much for one person to bear.

We all face some version of this question. Of course, the dollar amounts differ from person to person, often dramatically, but the core question is the same for all of us: What‚Äôs the best way to allocate our life energy before we die?

### ‚ú® Even then, bear in mind that I am basing these recommendations on my own modeling of what makes for a fulfilling life; I am not a financial adviser, and if I inspire you to think differently about how to manage your money, it‚Äôs a good idea for you to first work out the details of your personal situation with a professional, such as a certified financial planner or accountant.


I didn‚Äôt always think this way, and definitely not when I was working my first job after college. At the University of Iowa, I‚Äôd played football and majored in electrical engineering. Even though I loved engineering and still have that optimizing mindset, I knew by the time job recruiters came to campus that there was just no way I would pursue the typical engineering career path. Working for a company like, say, IBM, it would take me years of work on a subsection of a subsection of a chip to get a chance to do any actual design. That didn‚Äôt seem exciting. The rigid schedule‚Äîand with only a couple of weeks of vacation each year‚Äîwould get in the way of all the other things I wanted to do. To be sure, I was young and had delusions of grandeur. But I was certain there was something much better out there for me.

He said nobody had ever answered the question that way. Even though his patients are typically wealthy, many of them still have fears of running out of money. I told him I was working on an app to help people with that problem, and he said, ‚ÄúNo, you have to write a book. You have to get out there and tell the whole story‚Äîexplain all your concepts, and not just to users of the app. And you have to start now.‚Äù He even introduced me to some ghostwriters!

In Germany, he saw the horrors of Dachau. In the newly formed Czech Republic, he heard about life under Communist rule. In Paris, he and two friends he‚Äôd made whiled away an afternoon sitting in a park, just enjoying baguettes with cheese and wine and feeling like anything was possible. Eventually he made his way to the Greek islands. Somewhere along the way he fell in love with a woman and had sex on a beach for the first time. As he met locals and young travelers from all over, he learned more about himself and other people and cultures and felt his world opening up. His stories of the interesting cultures he‚Äôd seen and the connections he had made were so amazing, I felt pretty envious‚Äîand regretful that I hadn‚Äôt gone.

### ‚ú® But if you‚Äôre not one of the lucky ones‚Äîif you‚Äôre more in love with the paycheck you bring home than with the daily experiences of being in your office‚Äîthen the time has come to do a real gut check on your life and to determine what you really want to get out of it.


Some of that behavior is rational. It would be foolish to live every day as if it were your last: You wouldn‚Äôt bother to work, or study for a test, or visit the dentist. So it makes sense to delay gratification to some extent, because that pays off in the long run. But the sad truth is that too many people delay gratification for too long, or indefinitely. They put off what they want to do until it‚Äôs too late, saving money for experiences they will never enjoy. Living as if your life were infinite is the opposite of taking the long view: It‚Äôs terribly shortsighted.

I‚Äôm a big believer in these ideas, and I preach them whenever I get the chance. Whether it‚Äôs a 25-year-old afraid of pursuing her dream career and instead settling for a safe but soul-crushing job, or a 60-year-old multimillionaire who keeps working long hours in order to sock away more money for retirement instead of enjoying the great wealth he‚Äôs already accrued, I hate seeing people wasting their resources and putting off living life fully now‚Äîand I tell them so. As much as I possibly can, I also practice what I preach. Granted, sometimes I‚Äôm like a fat football coach on the sidelines, failing to follow my own advice. But when I catch myself doing that, I make corrections, some of which you‚Äôll read about later in this book. None of us are perfect, but I do my best to walk the talk.

Living life fully takes many forms. For example, I love to travel and I love poker, so I take lots of trips, some of them to play in poker tournaments. This means I spend a big percentage of my savings each year on travel and on poker. But don‚Äôt get me wrong: I am not an advocate for everyone spending their savings on travel, let alone poker. What I am an advocate for is deciding what makes you happy and then converting your money into the experiences you choose.
